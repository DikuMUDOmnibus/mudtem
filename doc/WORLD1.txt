Chapter 1:
Player Character Ability Scores 

Rolling Ability Scores 
	The six ability scores are determined randomly by rolling six-sided dice to obtain a score from 3 to 18. Acceptable methods of generating ability scores for player characters are as follows. 
 	Method I: Roll three six-sided dice (3d6); the total shown on the dice is your character's Strength ability score. Repeat this for Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, in that order. This method gives a range of scores from 3 to 18, with most results in the 9 to 12 range. Only a few characters have high scores (15 and above), so you should treasure these characters.

Alternative Dice-Rolling Methods 
	Method I creates characters whose ability scores are usually between 9 and 12. If you would rather play a character of truly heroic proportions, ask your DM if he allows players to use optional methods for rolling up characters. These optional methods are designed to produce above-average characters.
 	Method II: Roll 3d6 twice, noting the total of each roll. Use whichever result you prefer for your character's Strength score. Repeat this for Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This allows you to pick the best score from each pair, generally ensuring that your character does not have any really low ability scores (but low ability scores are not all that bad any way!).
 	Method III: Roll 3d6 six times and jot down the total for each roll. Assign the scores to your character's six abilities however you want. This gives you the chance to custom-tailor your character, although you are not guaranteed high scores.
 	Method IV: Roll 3d6 twelve times and jot down all twelve totals. Choose six of these rolls (generally the six best rolls) and assign them to your character's abilities however you want. This combines the best of methods II and III, but takes somewhat longer.
	As an example, Joan rolls 3d6 twelve times and gets results of 12, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 9, 12, 6, 11, 10, and 7. She chooses the six best rolls (15, 12, 12, 11, 10, and 10) and then assigns them to her character's abilities so as to create the strengths and weaknesses that she wants her character to have (see the ability descriptions following this section for explanations of the abilities).
 	Method V: Roll four six-sided dice (4d6). Discard the lowest die and total the remaining three. Repeat this five more times, then assign the six numbers to the character's abilities however you want. This is a fast method that gives you a good character, but you can still get low scores (after all, you could roll 1's on all four dice!).
 	Method VI: This method can be used if you want to create a specific type of character. It does not guarantee that you will get the character you want, but it will improve your chances.
	Each ability starts with a score of 8. Then roll seven dice. These dice can be added to your character's abilities as you wish. All the points on a die must be added to the same ability score. For example, if a 6 is rolled on one die, all 6 points must be assigned to one ability. You can add as many dice as you want to any ability, but no ability score can exceed 18 points. If you cannot make an 18 by exact count on the dice, you cannot have an 18 score.
    Method VII :  Roll eighteen six-sided dice, and assign them, three dice per score, to your character's abilities.
     Any variations or alternate methods must be discussed and approved by the Dungeon Master first.

Adjusting Ability Scores
     Regardless of the method used in rolling scores for a character, the player may opt to adjust the rolled ability scores by reducing one score by two points, and raising another by one point.  This may be done as many times as desired with only one restriction: no score may be adjusted to be less than 8, and no score may be adjusted to be more than 18.
     In addition, if Method V is used to generate ability scores, the player may use this method of adjusting scores instead of the option above: The player discards an undesired score that he or she rolled with 4d6, taking the best 3d6, and completely rerolls the score using only 3d6.  This can be done for as many scores as desired.  Note that if this option is used, the 2 for 1 adjustment method may not be used.     
     Option : A player of a female character may choose to apply one of the following optional modifiers to the character.  These options are presented to reflect the differences between the male and female physiology, however, none of the presented adjustments are required; the choice of which to apply, if any, are the option of the player.  Note that in no case may any adjustment presented below raise a score above 18, nor lower it below 3.  
     Option 1 : -2 Str, +1 Dex, +1 Con
     Option 2 : -1 Str, +1 Con
     Option 3 : -1 Str, +1 Dex

The Ability Scores 
The six character abilities are described below. Each description gives an idea of what that ability encompasses. Specific game effects are also given. At the end of each ability description is the table giving all modifiers and game information for each ability score. The blue-shaded ability scores can be obtained only by extraordinary means, whether by good fortune (finding a magical book that raises a score) or ill fortune (an attack by a creature that lowers a score).

Strength 
	Strength (Str) measures a character's muscle, endurance, and stamina. This ability is the prime requisite of fighters and fighter subclasses because they must be physically powerful in order to wear armor and wield heavy weapons.  Any fighter or fighter subclass with a Strength score of 18 (before any adjustments are made) is entitled to roll percentile dice to determine exceptional Strength; exceptional Strength improves the character's chance to hit an enemy, increases the damage he causes with each hit, increases the weight the character is able to carry without a penalty for encumbrance (see below), and increases the character's ability to force open doors and similar portals.
	Hit Probability adjustments are added to or subtracted from the attack roll rolled on 1d20 (one 20-sided die) during combat. A bonus (positive number) makes the opponent easier to hit; a penalty (negative number) makes him harder to hit.
	Damage Adjustment also applies to combat. The listed number is added to or subtracted from the dice rolled to determine the damage caused by an attack (regardless of subtractions, a successful attack roll can never cause less than 1 point of damage). For example, a short sword normally causes 1d6 points of damage (a range of 1 to 6). An attacker with Strength 17 causes one extra point of damage, for a range of 2 to 7 points of damage. The damage adjustment also applies to missile weapons, if the weapon is  specially made to gain the bonus; crossbows never benefit from the user's Strength.
	Weight Allowance is the weight (in pounds) a character can carry without being encumbered. These weights are expressed in pounds. A character carrying up to the listed weight can move his full movement rate.
	Maximum Press is the heaviest weight a character can pick up and lift over his head. A character cannot walk more than a few steps this way. No human or humanoid creature without exceptional Strength can lift more than twice his body weight over his head.
	Open Doors indicates the character's chance to force open a heavy or stuck door. When a character tries to force a door open, roll 1d20. If the result is equal to or less than the listed number, the door opens. A character can keep trying to open a door until it finally opens, but each attempt takes time (exactly how much is up to the DM) and makes a lot of noise.
	Numbers in parentheses are the chances (on 1d20) to open a locked, barred, or magically held door, but only one attempt per door can ever be made. If it fails, no further attempts by that character can succeed.
	Bend Bars/Lift Gates states the character's percentage chance (rolled on percentile dice) to bend normal, soft iron bars, lift a vertical gate (portcullis), or perform a similar feat of enormous strength. When the character makes the attempt, roll percentile dice. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number listed on the Strength Table, the character bends the bar or lifts the gate. If the attempt fails, the character can never succeed at that task. A character can, however, try to bend the bars on a gate that he couldn't lift, and vice versa.

Dexterity 
	Dexterity (Dex) encompasses several physical attributes including hand-eye coordination, agility, reaction speed, reflexes, and balance. Dexterity affects a character's reaction to a threat or surprise, his accuracy with thrown weapons and bows, and his ability to dodge an enemy's blows. It is the prime requisite of thieves and bards and affects their professional skills.
	Reaction Adjustment modifies the die roll to see if a character is surprised when he unexpectedly encounters NPCs. The more positive the modifier, the less likely the character is to be surprised.
	Missile Attack Adjustment is used to modify a character's die roll whenever he uses a missile weapon (a bow or a thrown weapon). A positive number makes it easier for the character to hit with a missile, while a negative number makes it harder.
	Defensive Adjustment applies against attacks that can be dodged, i.e. boulders, etc. It also modifies the character's Armor Class, representing his ability to dodge normal missiles and parry weapon thrusts.  (In some situations, beneficial Dexterity modifiers to Armor Class do not apply. Usually this occurs when a character is attacked from behind or when his movement is restricted--attacked while prone, tied up, on a ledge, climbing a rope, etc.)

Constitution 
	A character's Constitution (Con) score encompasses his physique, fitness, health, and physical resistance to hardship, injury, and disease. Since this ability affects the character's hit points and chances of surviving such tremendous shocks as being physically reshaped by magic or resurrected from death, it is vitally important to all classes. Some classes have minimum allowable Constitution scores.
	A character's initial Constitution score is the absolute limit to the number of times the character can be raised or resurrected from death. Each such revival reduces the character's Constitution score by one. Magic can restore a reduced Constitution score to its original value or even higher, but this has no effect on the number of times a character can be revived from death! Once the character has exhausted his original Constitution, nothing short of divine intervention can bring him back, and divine intervention is reserved for only the bravest and most faithful heroes!
	Hit Point Adjustment is added to or subtracted from each Hit Die rolled for the character. However, no Hit Die ever yields less than 1 hit point, regardless of modifications. If an adjustment would lower the number rolled to 0 or less, consider the final result to be 1. Always use the character's current Constitution to determine hit point bonuses and penalties.
	Only fighters and fighter subclasses are entitled to a Constitution bonus of +3 or +4. Non-fighter characters who have Constitution scores of 17 or 18 receive only +2 per die.
	The Constitution bonus ends when a character reaches 10th level (9th for clerics and fighters)--neither the Constitution bonus nor Hit Dice are added to a character's hit points after he has passed this level (see the character class descriptions in Chapter 3).
	If a character's Constitution changes during the course of adventuring, his hit points may be adjusted up or down to reflect the change. The difference between the character's current hit point bonus (if any) and the new bonus is multiplied by the character's level (up to 10) and added to or subtracted from the character's total.
	System Shock states the percentage chance a character has to survive magical effects that reshape or age his body: petrification (and reversing petrification), polymorph, magical aging, etc. It can also be used to see if the character retains consciousness in particularly difficult situations.
	Resurrection Survival lists a character's percentage chance to be successfully resurrected or raised from death by magic. The player must roll the listed number or less on percentile dice for the character to be revived. If the dice roll fails, the character is dead, regardless of how many times he has previously been revived. Only divine intervention can bring such a character back again.
	Poison Save modifies the saving throw vs. poison for humans, elves, gnomes, and half-elves. Dwarves and halflings do not use this adjustment, since they have special resistances to poison attacks. The DM has specific information on saving throws.
	Regeneration enables those with specially endowed Constitutions (perhaps by a wish or magical item) to heal at an advanced rate, regenerating damage taken. The character heals 1 point of damage after the passage of the listed number of turns. However, fire and acid damage (which are more extensive than normal wounds) cannot be regenerated in this manner. These injuries must heal normally or be dealt with by magical means.

Intelligence 
	Intelligence (Int) represents a character's memory, reasoning, and learning ability, including areas outside those measured by the written word. Intelligence dictates the number of languages a character can learn. Intelligence is the prime requisite of magic users, who must have keen minds to understand and memorize magical spells. The magic user's Intelligence dictates which spells he can learn and the number of spells he can memorize at one time. Only those of the highest Intelligence can comprehend the mighty magic of 9th-level spells.
	This ability gives only a general indication of a character's mental acuity. A semi-intelligent character (Int 3 or 4) can speak (with difficulty) and is apt to react instinctively and impulsively. He is not hopeless as a player character (PC), but playing such a character correctly is not easy. A character with low Intelligence (Int 5-7) could also be called dull-witted or slow. A very intelligent person (Int 11 or 12) picks up new ideas quickly and learns easily. A highly intelligent character (Int 13 or 14) is one who can solve most problems without even trying very hard. One with exceptional intelligence (Int 15 or 16) is noticeably above the norm. A genius character is brilliant (Int 17 or 18). A character beyond genius is potentially more clever and more brilliant than can possibly be imagined.
	However, the true capabilities of a mind lie not in numbers--I.Q., Intelligence score, or whatever. Many intelligent, even brilliant, people in the real world fail to apply their minds creatively and usefully, thus falling far below their own potential. Don't rely too heavily on your character's Intelligence score; you must provide your character with the creativity and energy he supposedly possesses!

	Number of Language Points lists the number of points the character can apply toward learning languages the character can speak, and possibly read and write, including his native language. Every character can speak his native language, no matter what his Intelligence is, however, the number of points allotted determine how well the character speaks it. Your DM can limit your language selection based on his campaign. It is perfectly fair to rule that your fighter from the Frozen Wastes hasn't the tongues of the Southland, simply because he has never met anyone who has been to the Southland.  Note that a character with Godlike intelligence will be able to know all languages at a level of 20.  This system replaces both the old system, and the reading/writing proficiency.  Consult with the DM regarding this.
	Spell Level lists the highest level of spells that can be cast by a magic user with this Intelligence.
	Chance to Learn Spell is the percentage probability that a magic user can learn a particular spell. A check is made as the magic user comes across new spells, not as he advances in level. To make the check, the magic user character must have access to a spell book containing the spell. If the player rolls the listed percentage or less, his character can learn the spell and copy it into his own spell book. If the magic user fails the roll, he cannot check that spell again until he advances to the next level (provided he still has access to the spell).
     Maximum Number of Spells per Level:  This number indicates the maximum number of spells a magic user can know from any particular spell level. Once a magic user has learned the maximum number of spells he is allowed in a given spell level, he cannot add any more spells of that level to his spell book (however, see the character class description of the magic user, below, for exceptions). Once a spell is learned, it cannot be unlearned and replaced by a new spell.
	Spell Immunity is gained by those with exceptionally high Intelligence scores. Those with the immunity notice some inconsistency or inexactness in the illusion or phantasm, automatically allowing them to make their saving throws. All benefits are cumulative, thus, a character with a 20 Intelligence is not fooled by 1st- or 2nd-level illusion spells.

Wisdom 
	Wisdom (Wis) describes a composite of the character's enlightenment, judgment, guile, willpower, common sense, and intuition. It can affect the character's resistance to magical attack. It is the prime requisite of clerics.  Clerics with Wisdom scores of 13 or higher gain bonus spells over and above the number they are normally allowed to use.
	Magical Defense Adjustment listed on the Wisdom Table applies to saving throws against magical spells that attack the mind: beguiling, charm, fear, hypnosis, illusions, possession, suggestion, etc. These bonuses and penalties are applied automatically, without any conscious effort from the character.
	Bonus Spells indicates the number of additional spells a cleric (and only a cleric) is entitled to because of his extreme Wisdom. Note that these spells are available only when the cleric is entitled to spells of the appropriate level. Bonus spells are cumulative, so a cleric with a Wisdom of 15 is entitled to two 1st-level bonus spells and one 2nd-level bonus spell.
	Chance of Spell Failure states the percentage chance that any particular spell fails when cast. Clerics with low Wisdom scores run the risk of having their spells fizzle. Roll percentile dice every time the cleric casts a spell; if the number rolled is less than or equal to the listed chance for spell failure, the spell is expended with absolutely no effect whatsoever. Note that clerics with Wisdom scores of 13 or higher don't need to worry about their spells failing.
	Spell Immunity gives those extremely wise characters complete protection from certain spells, spell-like abilities, and magical items as listed. These immunities are cumulative, so that a character with a Wisdom of 23 is immune to all listed spells up to and including those listed on the 23 Wisdom row.

Charisma 
	The Charisma (Cha) score measures a character's persuasiveness, personal magnetism, and ability to lead. It is not a reflection of physical attractiveness, although attractiveness certainly plays a role. It is important to all characters, but especially to those who must deal with nonplayer characters (NPCs), mercenary hirelings, retainers, and intelligent monsters. It dictates the total number of henchmen a character can retain and affects the loyalty of henchmen, hirelings, and retainers.
	Maximum Number of Henchmen states the number of nonplayer characters who will serve as permanent retainers of the player character. It does not affect the number of mercenary soldiers, men-at-arms, servitors, or other persons in the pay of the character.
	Loyalty Base shows the subtraction from or addition to the henchmen's and other servitors' loyalty scores (in the DMG). This is crucial during battles, when morale becomes important.
	Reaction Adjustment indicates the penalty or bonus due to the character because of Charisma when dealing with nonplayer characters and intelligent creatures. For example, Rath encounters a centaur, an intelligent creature. Rath's Charisma is only 6, so he is starting off with one strike against him. He probably should try to overcome this slight handicap by making generous offers of gifts or information.

Chapter 2: 
Player Character Races 

	All six of the standard races are described in detail in this chapter. In many cases, broad statements are made concerning the race in general. Players are not bound by these generalities. For example, the statement that "dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn" does not mean that your character cannot be a jolly dwarf. It means that the garden-variety dwarf is dour and taciturn. If player characters were just like everyone else, they wouldn't be adventurers. Make your character unique and he will be more fun to play. The native PC races of the world include mountain dwarves, hill dwarves, drow elves, grey elves, high elves, gnomes, half-elves of drow, grey, or high elf descent, hairfoot halflings, stout halflings, and humans.  Special PC races may be considered on a case by case basis, but must be discussed with the DM first.  The word of the DM is final and absolute.

Minimum and Maximum Ability Scores 
	All nonhuman PC races (also called "demihuman" races) have minimum and maximum requirements for their ability scores. If you want to have a demihuman character, the character's ability scores must be within the allowable range. Your character's sex has no effect on these minimums or maximums.   If the basic scores that you rolled up meet the requirements for a particular race, your character can be of that race, even if later modifications change the ability scores so they exceed the maximums or don't meet the minimums. Once you satisfy the requirements at the start, you never have to worry about them again.  Any character can be a human, if the player so desires.

Racial Ability Adjustments 
     If you chose to make your character a dwarf, elf, gnome, or halfling, you now have the option to adjust some of your character's ability scores.   The racial ability adjustments presented here are optional; use them if you want, forget them if you want, I don't care.  The only restriction that is placed on using them is that no ability score for any beginning player character may exceed a score of 18, no matter to what score the modifier would adjust it.  Even if adjustments raise or lower your character's ability scores beyond the minimums and maximums shown below,, you do not have to pick a new race.

Class Restrictions and Level Limits 
	The human race has one special ability in the AD&D game: Humans can choose to be of any class-- warrior, magic user, cleric, or thief -- and can rise to great level in any class. The other races have fewer choices of character classes and usually are limited in the level they can attain. These restrictions reflect the natural tendencies of the races (dwarves like war and fighting and dislike magic, etc.). The DM will determine level limits imposed on nonhuman characters.

Languages 
   
The Language Point System:
   Each character starts with a certain number of language points, relative to his or her intelligence score.  These may be allocated to any language, to a maximum of 20 points applied to any one language.   Characters wishing to learn to speak a language which is not a humanoid language must spend 30 points initially in order to have the benefit of having the language in the first place, plus spend additional points to improve in the ability ( i.e. allocating 38 points to the language of horses would allow a character to converse in horse at a level of 8 ).  Note that if the creature does not have a written language, there is no possibility to read and write it, and thus the references to literacy level do not apply to that language.


What the numbers mean :

   1 : recognises spoken letters and numbers; illiterate
   2 : 
   3 : 
   4 : recognises and speaks a few simple phrases; illiterate
   5 : 
   6 : 
   7 : moderate level speaking ability, around the level of a 4 year old child; illiterate
   8 : can recognise written letters and numbers, but cannot read
   9 : adequately fluent, enough so that if spoken to slowly and clearly, and in simple terms, will understand; illiterate
 10 :
 11 : conversationally fluent, can hold relatively simple conversations, ask for common things ( food, drink, where's the outhouse, etc. ); reads at the level of the average 8 year old
 12 :
 13 : good fluency in speech, able to converse at a normal conversational level, though with unusual accentuation if not the character's native language, and most idiomatic expressions are unrecognised ; reads at the level of the average 12 year old
 14 : adequate level of literacy equivalent to the average 14 year old.
 15 : most idiomatic expressions known; literacy at the level of the average 17 year old
 16 : exceptional speaking ability, familiar with complex expressions 
 17 : highly literate, at least collegiate level reading and writing skill
 18 : familiar with highly complex expressions
 19 : exceptional literacy, at the level of expert novelist ( i.e. Stephen Donaldson, Tom Clancy )
 20 : linguistics expert in both speaking and reading/writing, can accentuate perfectly in the language, even if it is not the character's native language.

      Note : All magical items that are not specifically suited to the character's class have a 20% chance to malfunction when used by a dwarf.
      A dwarven member of the fighter class or any fighter subclass is entitled to the possibility of possessing exceptional strength. 

  Dwarves are short, stocky fellows, easily identified by their size and shape. They average 4 to 4-1/2 feet tall. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair. Dwarves generally live for 450 years.
	Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work and care little for most humor. They are strong and brave. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, and even stronger drink. Their chief love, however, is precious metal, particularly gold. They prize gems, of course, especially diamonds and opaque gems (except pearls, which they do not like). Dwarves like the earth and dislike the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they have a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins. Their short, stocky builds make them ill-suited for riding horses or other large mounts (although ponies present no difficulty), so they tend to be a trifle dubious and wary of these creatures. They are ill-disposed toward magic and have little talent for it, but revel in fighting, warcraft, and scientific arts such as engineering.  Though dwarves are suspicious and avaricious, their courage and tenacity more than compensate for these shortcomings.	Dwarves typically dwell in hilly or mountainous regions. They prefer life in the comforting gloom and solidness that is found underground. They have several special abilities that relate to their underground life, and they are noted for being particularly resistant to magic and poisons.
	From living underground, dwarves have found it useful to learn the languages of several of their neighbors, both friendly and hostile. The initial languages a dwarf can learn are common, dwarf, gnome, goblin, kobold, orc, and any others your DM allows. The actual number of languages is limited by the Intelligence of the player character.  By nature, dwarves are nonmagical and never use magical spells (cleric spells are allowed however). This gives a bonus to dwarves' saving throws against attacks from magical wands, staves, rods, and spells. This bonus is +1 for every 31/2 points of Constitution score. Thus, for example, if a dwarf has a Constitution score of 7 he gains +2 on saving throws. These bonuses are summarized on the table below.

Constitution Saving Throw Bonuses

Constitution Score	Saving Throw Bonus
		  4-6			+1
		  7-10			+2
		11-13			+3
		14-17			+4
		18-19			+5

	Similarly, dwarves have exceptional resistance to toxic substances. All dwarven characters make saving throws against poison with the same bonuses that they get against magical attacks.
	Also because of their nonmagical nature, however, dwarves have trouble using magical items. All magical items that are not specifically suited to the character's class have a 20% chance to malfunction when used by a dwarf. This check is made each time a dwarf uses a magical item. A malfunction affects only the current use; the item may work properly next time. For devices that are continually in operation, the check is made the first time the device is used during an encounter. If the check is passed, the device functions normally until it is turned off. Thus, a dwarf would have to check upon donning a robe of blending but would not check again until he had taken the robe off and then put it on again. If a cursed item malfunctions, the character recognizes its cursed nature and can dispose of the item. Malfunction applies to rods, staves, wands, rings, amulets, potions, horns, jewels, and all other magical items except weapons, shields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles. This penalty does not apply to dwarven clerics using cleric items.
	In melee, dwarves add 1 to their dice rolls to hit orcs, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins. When ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, or titans attack dwarves, these monsters must subtract 4 from their attack rolls because of the dwarves' small size and combat ability against these much bigger creatures.
	Dwarven infravision enables them to see up to 60 feet in the dark.
	Dwarves are miners of great skill. While underground, they can detect the following information when within 10 feet of the particular phenomenon (but they can determine their approximate depth below the surface at any time).

Detect grade or slope in passage	1-5 on 1d6
Detect new tunnel/passage construction	1-5 on 1d6
Detect sliding/shifting walls or rooms	1-4 on 1d6
Detect stonework traps, pits, and deadfalls	1-3 on 1d6
Determine approximate depth underground	1-3 on 1d6

	Note that the dwarf must deliberately try to make these determinations; the information does not simply spring to mind unbidden.

                                   Find secret doors                                                    2 in 6
                                   Find concealed doors                                             3 in 6
      An elven member of the fighter class or any fighter subclass is entitled to the possibility of possessing exceptional strength.

     Elves tend to be somewhat shorter and slimmer than normal humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Although they appear fragile and weak, as a race they are quick and strong. Elves often live to be over 600 years old.  Elves are often considered frivolous and aloof. In fact, they are not, although humans often find their personalities impossible to fathom. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing and frolicking, playing and singing, unless necessity dictates otherwise. They are not fond of ships or mines, but enjoy growing things and gazing at the open sky. Even though elves tend toward haughtiness and arrogance at times, they regard their friends and associates as equals. They do not make friends easily, but a friend (or enemy) is never forgotten. They prefer to distance themselves from humans, have little love for dwarves, and hate the evil denizens of the woods.
	Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. Elves are brave but never foolhardy. They eat sparingly; they drink mead and wine, but seldom to excess. While they find well-wrought jewelry a pleasure to behold, they are not overly interested in money or gain. They find magic and swordplay (or any refined combat art) fascinating. If they have a weakness it lies in these interests.
	There are three branches of the elven race; drow, gray, and high. Elf player characters are always assumed to be of the most common type -- high elves -- although a character can be another type of elf with the DM's permission (but the choice grants no additional powers). To the eye of outsiders, the differences between the groups are mostly cosmetic, but most elves maintain that there are important cultural differences between the various groups. Gray elves are considered the most noble and serious-minded of this breed. High elves are the most common. All others hold that the subterranean dark elves are corrupt and evil, no longer part of the elven community.
	Elves have found it useful to learn the languages of several of the forest's children, both the good and the bad. As initial languages, an elf can choose common, elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. The number of languages an elf can learn is limited by his Intelligence.
	Elven characters have 90% resistance to sleep and all charm-related spells. (See Chapter 9: Combat for an explanation of magic resistance.) This is in addition to the normal saving throw allowed against a charm spell.
	When employing a bow of any sort other than a crossbow, or when using a short or long sword, elves gain a bonus of +1 to their attack rolls.
	An elf can gain a bonus to surprise opponents, but only if the elf is not in metal armor. Even then, the elf must either be alone, or with a party comprised only of elves or halflings (also not in metal armor), or 90 feet or more away from his party (the group of characters he is with) to gain this bonus. If he fulfills these conditions, he moves so silently that opponents suffer a -4 penalty to their surprise die rolls. If the elf must open a door or screen to attack, this penalty is reduced to -2.
	Elven infravision enables them to see up to 90 feet in darkness.
	Secret doors (those constructed so as to be hard to notice) and concealed doors (those hidden from sight by screens, curtains, or the like) are difficult to hide from elves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a concealed door gives an elven character a one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) to notice it. If actively searching for such doors, elven characters have a  one-in-three chance (roll a 1 or 2 on 1d6) to find a secret door and a one-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6) to discover a concealed portal.

      Note : All magical items that are not specifically suited to the character's class have a 20% chance to malfunction when used by a gnome.
      A gnomish member of the fighter class or any fighter subclass is entitled to the possibility of possessing exceptional strength.

     Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Their noses, however, are significantly larger. Most gnomes have dark tan or brown skin and white hair. A typical gnome lives for 450 years.
	Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a great love of living things and finely wrought items, particularly gems and jewelry. Gnomes love all sorts of precious stones and are masters of gem polishing and cutting.
	Gnomes prefer to live in areas of rolling, rocky hills, well wooded and uninhabited by humans. Their diminutive stature has made them suspicious of the larger races--humans and elves--although they are not hostile. They are sly and furtive with those they do not know or trust, and somewhat reserved even under the best of circumstances. Dwelling in mines and burrows, they are sympathetic to dwarves, but find their cousins' aversion to surface dwellers foolish.
	Due to his upbringing, a beginning gnome character can choose to know the following languages, in addition to any others allowed by the DM: common, dwarf, gnome, halfling, goblin, kobold, and the simple common speech of burrowing mammals (moles, badgers, weasels, shrews, ground squirrels, etc.). The actual number of languages a character begins with depends upon his Intelligence score.
	Like their cousins the dwarves, gnomes are highly magic resistant. A gnome player character gains a bonus of +1 for every 31/2 points of Constitution score, just as dwarves do. This bonus applies to saving throws against magical wands, staves, rods, and spells.
	Gnomes also suffer a 20% chance for failure every time they use any magical item except weapons, armor, shields, illusionist items, and (if the character is a thief) items that duplicate thieving abilities. This check is made each time the gnome attempts to use the device, or, in the case of continuous-use devices, each time the device is activated. Like dwarves, gnomes can sense a cursed item if the device fails to function.
	In melee, gnome characters add 1 to their attack rolls to hit kobolds or goblins. When gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, or titans attack gnomes, these monsters must subtract 4 from their attack rolls because of the gnomes' small size and their combat skills against these much larger creatures.
	Gnomish infravision enables them to see up to 60 feet in the dark.
	Being tunnelers of exceptional merit, gnomes are able to detect the following within 10 feet (exception: They can determine their approximate depth or direction underground at any time.). They must stop and concentrate for one round to use any of these abilities.

Detect grade or slope in passage	1-5 on 1d6
Detect unsafe walls, ceiling, and floors	1-7 on 1d10
Determine approximate depth underground	1-4 on 1d6
Determine approximate direction underground	1-3 on 1d6

      A half-elven member of the fighter class or any fighter subclass is entitled to the possibility of possessing exceptional strength.              

     Half-elves are the most common mixed-race beings.  Half-elves are usually much like their elven parent in appearance. They are handsome folk, with the good features of each of their races. They mingle freely with either race, being only slightly taller than the average elf (5 feet 6 inches on average) and weighing about 150 pounds. They typically live about 375 years. They do not have all the abilities of the elf, nor do they have the flexibility of unlimited level advancement of the human. Finally, in some of the less-civilized nations, half-elves are viewed with suspicion and superstition.
	In general, a half-elf has the curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition of his human ancestors and the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of his elven ancestors.  Half-elves do not form communities among themselves; rather, they can be found living in both elven and human communities. The reactions of humans and elves to half-elves ranges from intrigued fascination to outright bigotry.
	Half-elves do not have a language of their own. Their extensive contact with other races enables them to choose any of the following languages (plus any other allowed by the DM): common, elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. The actual number of languages the character knows is limited by his Intelligence.
	Half-elven characters have a 30% resistance to sleep and all charm-related spells.
	Half-elven infravision enables them to see up to 90 feet in darkness.
	Secret or concealed doors are difficult to hide from half-elves, just as they are from elves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a concealed door (one hidden by obstructing curtains, etc.) gives the half-elven character a one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) of spotting it. If the character is actively seeking to discover hidden doors, he has a one-in-three chance (roll a 1 or 2 on 1d6) of spotting  a secret door (one constructed to be undetectable) and a one-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6) of locating a concealed door.

     Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad and often quite florid. Their hair is typically curly and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. They prefer not to wear shoes whenever possible. Their typical life expectancy is approximately 150 years.
	Halflings are sturdy and industrious, generally quiet and peaceful. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun stories. In fact, they can be a trifle boring at times. Halflings are not forward, but they are observant and conversational if in friendly company. Halflings see wealth only as a means of gaining creature comforts, which they love. Though they are not overly brave or ambitious, they are generally honest and hard working when there is need.
	Halfling homes are well-furnished burrows, although most of their work is done on the surface. Elves generally like them in a patronizing sort of way. Dwarves cheerfully tolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat soft and harmless. Gnomes, although they drink more and eat less, like halflings best, feeling them kindred spirits. Because halflings are more open and outgoing than any of these other three, they get along with other races far better.
	There are two types of halflings: Hairfeets and Stouts. Hairfeets are the most common type, but for player characters, either of the two is acceptable.
	Through their contact with other races, halfling characters are allowed to choose initial languages from common, halfling, dwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, and orc, in addition to any other languages the DM allows. The actual number of languages the character knows is limited by his Intelligence.
	All halfling characters have a high resistance to magical spells, so for every 3 1/2 points of Constitution score, the character gains a +1 bonus on saving throws vs. wands, staves, rods, and spells.
	Halflings have a similar resistance to poisons of all sorts, so they gain a Constitution bonus identical to that for saving throws vs. magical attacks when they make saving throws vs. poison (i.e., +1 to +5, depending on Constitution score).
	Halflings have a natural talent with slings and thrown weapons. Rock pitching is a favorite sport of many a halfling child. All halflings gain a +1 bonus to their attack rolls when using thrown weapons and slings.
	A halfling can gain a bonus to surprise opponents, but only if the halfling is not in metal armor. Even then, the halfling must either be alone, or with a party comprised only of halflings or elves, or 90 feet or more away from his party to gain this bonus. If he fulfills any of these conditions, he causes a -4 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. If a door or other screen must be opened, this penalty is reduced to -2.
	Depending on their lineage, certain halfling characters have infravision. Any halfling character has a 15% chance to have normal infravision (this means he is pure Stout), out to 60 feet; failing that chance, there is a 25% chance that he has limited infravision (mixed Stout/Hairfeets lineage), effective out to 30 feet.
	Similarly, halflings with any Stoutish blood can note if a passage is an up or down grade with 75% accuracy (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d4). They can determine direction half the time (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6). These abilities function only when the character is concentrating on the desired information to the exclusion of all else, and only if the character is pure or partially Stout.

      A human member of the fighter class or any fighter subclass is entitled to the possibility of possessing exceptional strength. 

     Although humans are treated as a single race in the AD&D game, they come in all the varieties we know on Earth. A human PC can have whatever racial characteristics the DM allows.
	Humans have only one special ability: They can be of any character class and rise to any level in any class. Other PC races have limited choices in these areas.  Humans are also more social and tolerant than most other races, accepting the company of elves, dwarves, and the like with noticeably less complaint.  Because of these abilities and tendencies, humans have become significant powers within the world and often rule empires that other races (because of their racial tendencies) would find difficult to manage.

Other Characteristics 
After you have selected a race, you may want to fill in the details of your character. You are not required to do so, but there are many situations in which this information is vital or useful to role-playing.  The sex and name of your character are up to you. Your character can be of the same sex as yourself or of the opposite sex.
	Some people feel it is important to know whether their character is right- or left-handed. Actually, this has no bearing on the play of the game, since all characters are assumed to be reasonably competent with either hand (that doesn't mean everyone is trained to fight with two weapons). It is easiest to say that your character has the same handedness as you. This will result in the normal ratio of right- to left-handed people.
	On occasion it may be useful to know your character's height and weight. The best way to determine height and weight is to choose the appropriate numbers, subject to your DM's approval. If you want a short, pudgy human fighter, you can select an appropriate height and weight.  If you really must use tables and charts for height and weight, I personally recommend using those found in the article Realistic Vital Statistics, found in the Dragon, issue #91.   No tables, charts, or specifications are used for the determination of height and weight; these characteristics are to be determined in discussion between the player and the DM.  If you are a chart and dice dependent player, however, go ahead and use whatever charts make you happy. 
	Players may also want to know their characters' starting ages. Human characters can start at any age that is agreeable to both the player and the DM. However, all beginning adventurers are assumed to be at least 14 years old, since they must grow physically, emotionally, and in practical experience before they are ready to undertake the rigors of an adventuring life.  This world uses a modified version of the old "Gygaxian" system for character age.  It is preferred by the DM, and it makes more sense, especially in the case of elves, where the description in the 2nd edition Players Handbook invents some crap about venerable elves leaving the realms of men to go somewhere else ( perhaps a nursing home ? ). The maximum age for a character should be secretly determined and recorded by the DM. Player characters may have an idea of how long they expect to live, but do not know their true allotted life span.

Effects of Aging :
     The Dungeon Master will determine if and what the effects of character aging are for each character, but in general, these are the effects by age category :
           Young Adult  :  -1 Wis; +1 Con
           Mature             :  +1 Str; +1 Wis
           Middle Aged  :  -1 Str; -1 Con; +1 Int; +1 Wis
           Old                   :  -2 Str; -2 Dex; -1 Con; +1 Wis
           Venerable        :  -1 Str; -1 Dex; -1 Con; +1 Int; +1 Wis

	There may be times when a magical device or spell adds years to or subtracts years from a player character's life. This magical aging can have two different effects. Some magical aging physically affects the character. For example, a haste spell ages those it affects by one year. This aging is added directly to the player character's current age. He physically acquires the appearance of himself one year older (a few more wrinkles, etc.). Characters who increase in age from magical effects do not gain the benefits of increased Wisdom and Intelligence--these are a function of the passage of game time--but the character does suffer the physical losses to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution associated with aging. These are breakdowns of the body's systems. Physical age can also be removed in the same manner. Some potions give years back to the character. In this case, the physical appearance of the character is restored. The character can regain lost vigor (Str, Dex, and Con) as his body is renewed but he does not lose any of the benefits of aging (Wis and Int).
	Magical aging can also work to increase or decrease the life span of the character. In such a case, the actual age of the character is unaffected. All adjustments are made by the DM to the character's maximum age (which only the DM knows). For example, a human finds a magical fountain that bestows great longevity (10 to 60 years more). The DM has already determined the human will naturally live to 103 years (base 90 + 2d20, in this case 13). The water of the fountain bestows 40 more years so that, unless the character meets a violent end, he will live to 143 years. He still suffers the effects of aging at the usual ages (45, 60, and 90 years, respectively), but the period in which he would be considered a venerable elder of his people is extended for 40 years.
	There are a number of other personal characteristics your character has--hair and eye color, body shape, voice, noticeable features, and general personality. There are no tables for these things, nor should there be. Your job, as a player, is to add these details, thereby creating the type of character you want.



Chapter 3: 
Player Character Classes 

After choosing your character's race, you select his character class. A character class is like a profession or career. It is what your character has worked and trained at during his younger years. If you wanted to become a doctor, you could not walk out the door and begin work immediately. First you would have to get some training. The same is true of character classes in the AD&D game. Your character is assumed to have some previous training and guidance before beginning his adventuring career. Now, armed with a little knowledge, your character is ready to make his name and fortune.  Allowable character classes are described below.  To help you choose your character's class, each class and its subclasses are described briefly.

	Cleric: A cleric sees to the spiritual needs of a community or location.  All clerics are priests of specific mythoi, and are documented below.  All are unique from the world of play, and no other types of clerics exist; there is no "generic" cleric class, nor druid class, and the various specialty priests found in the supplemental books do not exist either.
	Fighter: There are four different classes of fighter types: fighter, condottiere, paladin, and ranger. All are well-trained in the use of weapons and skilled in the martial arts.
	Magic user: The magic user strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research.  A magic user must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Magic users are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms.  Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of magic users. The typical magic user studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring. The illusionist is an example of how a magic user can specialize in a particular school of magic, illusion in this case.
	Thief: The thief can be found throughout the world, wherever people gather and money changes hands. While many are motivated only by a desire to amass fortune in the easiest way possible, some have noble aims; they use their skills to correct injustice, spread good will, or contribute to the success of an adventuring group.
	The two types are thieves and bards.  To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, the thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are his hallmarks. Whether he turns his talent against innocent passers-by and wealthy merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for the thief to make.
	The bard is also a thief type, but he is very different from the thief. His strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Class Ability Score Requirements 
	Each of the character classes has minimum scores in various abilities. A character must satisfy these minimums to be of that class. If your character's scores are too low for him to belong to any character class, ask your DM for permission to reroll one or more of your ability scores or to create an entirely new character. If you desperately want your character to belong to a particular class but have scores that are too low, your DM might allow you to increase these scores to the minimum needed. However, you must ask him first. Don't count on the DM allowing you to raise a score above 16 in any case.

The complete character class descriptions that follow give the specific, detailed information you need about each class. These are organized according to groups. Information that applies to the entire group is presented at the start of the section. Each character class within the group is then explained.

The Cleric :
     All clerics are priests of specific mythoi, and are documented below.  All are unique from the world of play, and no other types of clerics exist; there is no "generic" cleric class, nor druid class, and the various specialty priests found in the supplemental books do not exist either.  Priests from other worlds can enter, but will not have any priestly powers because their deities do not have influence in this world ( unless they worship one of the established deities of this world who also has influence in their home world.  All clerics use the same table for experience levels and the same spell advancement tables, regardless of which deity is worshiped.  Specific descriptions for deities and their priests are found in the appendix at the end of the text.

Spells Allowed
     A cleric of a particular mythos is allowed to cast the spells from only a few, related spheres. The cleric's deity will have major and minor accesses to certain spheres, and this determines the spells available to the cleric. (Each deity's access to spheres is determined by the DM as he creates the pantheon of his world.) The 16 spheres of influence are defined in the following paragraphs.
     A cleric whose deity grants major access to a sphere can choose from any spell within that sphere (provided he is high enough in level to cast it), while one allowed only minor access to the sphere is limited to spells of 3rd level or below in that sphere. The combination of major and minor accesses to spheres results in a wide variation in the spells available to clerics who worship different deities.
     All refers to spells usable by any cleric, regardless of mythos. There are no Powers (deities) of the Sphere of All. This group includes spells the cleric needs to perform basic functions.
     Animal spells are those that affect or alter creatures. It does not include spells that affect people. Deities of nature and husbandry typically operate in this sphere.
     Astral is a small sphere of spells that enable movement or communication between the different planes of existence. The masters of a plane or particularly meddlesome powers often grant spells from this sphere.
     Charm spells are those that affect the attitudes and actions of people. Deities of love, beauty, trickery, and art often allow access to this sphere.
     Combat spells are those that can be used to directly attack or harm the enemies of the cleric or his mythos. These are often granted by deities of war or death.
     Creation spells enable the cleric to produce something from nothing, often to benefit his followers. This sphere can fill many different roles, from a provider to a trickster.
     Divination enables the cleric to learn the safest course of action in a particular situation, find a hidden item, or recover long-forgotten information. Deities of wisdom and knowledge typically have access to this sphere.
     Elemental spells are all those that affect the four basic elements of creation--earth, air, fire, and water. Nature deities, elemental deities, those representing or protecting various crafts, and the deities of sailors would all draw spells from this sphere.
     Guardian spells place magical sentries over an item or person. These spells are more active than protection spells because they create an actual guardian creature of some type. Protective, healing, and trickster deities may all grant spells of this sphere.
     Healing spells are those that cure diseases, remove afflictions, or heal wounds. These spells cannot restore life or regrow lost limbs. Healing spells can be reversed to cause injury, but such use is restricted to evil clerics. Protective and merciful deities are most likely to grant these spells, while nature deities may have lesser access to them.
     Necromantic spells restore to a creature some element of its life-force that has been totally destroyed. It might be life, a limb, or an experience level. These spells in reverse are powerfully destructive, and are used only by extremely evil clerics. Deities of life or death are most likely to act in this sphere.
     Plant spells affect plants, ranging from simple agriculture (improving crops and the like) to communicating with plant-like creatures. Agricultural and nature Powers grant spells in this sphere.
     Protection spells create mystical shields to defend the cleric or his charges from evil attacks. War and protective deities are most likely to use these, although one devoted to mercy and kindness might also bestow these spells.
     Summoning spells serve to call creatures from other places, or even other dimensions, to the service of the cleric. Such service is often against the will of the creature, so casting these spells often involves great risk. Since creatures summoned often cause great harm and destruction, these spells are sometimes bestowed by war or death powers.
     Sun spells are those dealing in the basic powers of the solar universe--the purity of light and its counterpart darkness. Sun spells are very common with nature, agricultural, or life-giving powers.
     Weather spells enable the cleric to manipulate the forces of weather. Such manipulation can be as simple as providing rain to parched fields, or as complex as unbridling the power of a raging tempest. Not surprisingly, these tend to be the province of nature and agricultural powers and appear in the repertoire of sea and ocean powers.

Fighters 
     Fighters and fighter subclasses encompass the character classes of heroes who make their way in the world primarily by skill at arms: fighters, condottieri, paladins, and rangers.  Fighters are allowed to use any weapon. They can wear any type of armor. Fighters get 1 to 10 (1d10) hit points per level and can gain a special Constitution hit point bonus that is available only to fighters.  The disadvantage fighters have is that they are restricted in their selection of magical items and spells.  All fighter types gain the ability to make more than one melee attack per round as they rise in level. The table below shows how many melee attacks fighters, condottieri, paladins, and rangers can make per round, as a function of their levels.  In addition, there are ways that fighters and subclasses can gain additional attacks per round prior to advancing to the experience level indicated in the table.
		Level       	Attacks/Round
		1-6	                   1/round
		7-12	                 3/2 rounds
		13 & up	                  2/round

The Fighter :

Ability Requirements :  Strength         9
Prime Requisites :          Strength 
Races Allowed    :          Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-elf, Halfling

     The principal attribute of the fighter and its subclasses is strength.  To become a fighter, a character must have a minimum strength score of  9.  High constitution is also desirable.  Fighters make their way in the world by skill at weaponry, combat, physical strength, strategy and tactics.  Fighters can have any alignment.  As a master of weapons, a fighter is the only character able to take advantage of the benefits of weapon specialization; no other character class can specialize in a weapon, not even those of a fighter subclass.  The rules regarding weapon specialization have been changed slightly, so if your fighter character is destined to be a specialist, read the section in the proficiencies section regarding weapon specialization very carefully.  While fighters can not cast magical spells, they can use many magic items, including most potions, rings, armor and weapons.

The Condottiere :

Ability Requirements :  Strength        15
                                         Dexterity        12

                                         Charisma       16
Prime Requisites :          none
Races Allowed    :          Human, Elf, Half-elf, Dwarf

     The condottiere is a fighter subclass which has been given exceptional, extensive training in the use of melee and missile weapons, mounted combat, and weaponless  combat, as well as given instruction in being a leader and a mercenary.  Condottieri are also trained extensively in the skills of animal handling, falling safely, horsemanship, survival, and tracking.  These skills are learned in all environments, and the condottiere is skilled enough in all environmental conditions to be able to survive anywhere on a basic level, at least.  A condottiere must have the following minimum ability scores in order to qualify for the class :  Strength 15, Dexterity 12, Constitution 13, Intelligence 16, Wisdom 14, Charisma 16.  There is no prime requisite score for the condottiere class, for all abilities are of great importance to the condottiere, and thus, condottieri do not receive a bonus to earned experience for exceptional ability scores.  Condottieri gain a constitution bonus of +1 hit point per point of constitution above 13, and this replaces the normal constitution bonuses detailed in the Players Handbook.  Condottieri also gain a bonus of +5% to both their system shock survival and resurrection survival rolls, and this bonus will still apply, even if the adjusted percentage is greater than 100% (automatic survival).
     A condottiere must be neutral in alignment in some respect.  The only alignments that are forbidden are the extreme alignments ( LG, CG, CE, LE ).  Any change to a non-neutral alignment causes the condottiere to become a fighter ( without the privilege of weapon specialization) of one level lower than he or she was as a condottiere, and to lose all special condottiere abilities.  The character is everafter a fighter, and can never regain condottiere status.
     Mountain dwarves, grey elves, high elves, half-elves ( of grey elf or high elf descent ), and humans may become condottieri.  Dwarven, elven, and half-elven  condottieri may not be multi-classed, and human condottieri may not dual-class; the combination of a condottiere with another class in a multi-class or dual-class character is strictly forbidden.  There is not enough free time for a condottiere to engage in the pursuits of an additional character class.

The condottiere begins with 1d10+4 hit points at first level, and thereafter gains 1d10 hit points per level for each level up to and including the 11th.

= 395000 experience points per level for each level beyond the 16th.
= Condottieri gain 4 hit points at 12th level, and 3 hit points per level beyond the 12th.

     Condottieri use the same combat tables as all other fighter classes, and may use any type of armor, shield, or weapon.  A condottiere, however, will disdain the use of leather, padded, studded leather, or other nonmetal armor types, preferring instead to wear piecemeal metal armor, bronze, silver, or even no armor.  The only time a condottiere will wear nonmetal armor is when there is absolutely no other choice, and even then, will do so grudgingly and want to replace it as soon as possible.  In addition, if a condottiere has a suit of  field plate or full plate armor, it will always be undecorated.  Condottieri do not apply ornamentation to armor or weapons, or to any other articles or items which they use while campaigning.   Magical armor will be preferred only if it is primarily constructed of metal.
     A condottiere begins with five initial weapon proficiency slots, and of the initial weapons chosen, a sword, a bow, and a lance must be included.  Any type of sword may be chosen except for the falchion, the khopesh, and the two handed sword ( except that a dwarven condottiere may use a falchion); the bow may be of any type which is not a crossbow, and the lance may be of any type.
     In addition, condottieri prefer to use certain weapons over others, and will  tend to attain proficiency in those weapons before any others . The preferred weapons of the condottiere are as follows ( in no particular order of preference ) : longsword, battle axe, spear, bow, dagger, lance, short sword.  The falchion is also a preferred weapon for dwarven condottieri.  Other commonly used weapons are : bastard sword, javelin, broadsword, morning star, horseman's military pick, staff, rapier, trident, and palspar. 



     Because of exceptional vigorous training, a condottiere may choose one single, specific weapon in which his or her skill in its use excels beyond simple proficiency.  Such a weapon must either be one of the preferred weapons of the condottiere ( listed above ), or approved by the Dungeon Master.  This weapon must be some sort of melee weapon, not a bow or other missile weapon.  The weapon most often chosen by condottieri is a sword of some type, though it is not required to be such.  With this specific weapon, the condottiere's skilled weapon of advancement, the condottiere gains a bonus of +1 "to hit" and +1 to damage at first level, and an additional +1 "to hit" and +1 to damage for every three experience levels attained by the condottiere beyond first level.  The condottiere also gains additional attacks with his or her skilled weapon of advancement at higher levels.  At 7th to 12th level, the condottiere may attack twice per round, and at 13th level and above, may attack three times per round  with this specific weapon.  This applies only to the condottiere's skilled weapon of advancement, and not to any other weapon in which the condottiere has proficiency.
     A condottiere may also take a proficiency in two weapon fighting.  This allows the condottiere to fight wielding a weapon in each hand without penalty, provided that each individual weapon can easily be wielded in one hand.  This proficiency also allows the condottiere one additional attack per round with the second weapon.  The skill costs one weapon proficiency slot, and the two weapons to be used with this proficiency must be specific ( i.e.  longsword and dagger is specific enough, two swords is not.).  The condottiere can only use the specified weapons together without penalty; any other two weapon combinations will incur the standard penalties for two weapon use, as per the Players Handbook.  Obviously, the condottiere cannot use a shield while wielding a weapon in each hand.  Unlike the ranger, the condottiere need not be wearing any specific armor types when using this skill.  When a condottiere wields a weapon in which he or she is not proficient, a non-proficiency penalty of -3 is applied.
     In addition to weapon proficiencies, condottieri are also extensively instructed in weaponless combat.  When employing weaponless fighting techniques, the condottiere attacks two times per round, and always wins initiative.  The condottiere may attack with either two hand strikes, or a hand strike and a kick when fighting without a weapon or a shield.  When a condottiere utilizes weaponless combat, the player must state which weaponless attacks will be employed each round which the condottiere is using his or her specialized techniques.  "To hit" rolls must be made for each attack.  Reaction adjustments for dexterity apply to "to hit" rolls, and strength bonuses to damage apply to condottiere weaponless combat.  Damage per attack varies with the level of the condottiere, and the table for this is given below.
     A condottiere may also attempt to kick at the end of a melee round in which he or she attacked with a weapon, if the condottiere is not carrying or using a shield, however, the kick is delivered at -3 "to hit", and the condottiere must make a dexterity check vs. 4d6 or fall prone and be stunned and unable to attack for two rounds.  Such a penalty only applies if the condottiere is holding a weapon while doing so, and such a maneuver is impossible if he or she is holding or using a shield, but it is possible if the condottiere is wielding a weapon in each hand.

Condottiere Table II : Weaponless Combat Damage

   Level                   Hand Damage             Kick Damage
    1 - 4                            1d3+1                           1d4+1
    5 - 8                            1d4+1                             2d3 
    9 - 11                            2d3                              1d6+2
  12 - 14                          1d6+2                            2d4+2
     15+                            2d4+2                            2d6+2

     Condottieri begin with 4 nonweapon proficiency slots at first level, and as fighters, gain one additional proficiency slot for every three levels of experience attained by the condottiere.  Unlike any other class, the condottiere is entitled to choose nonweapon proficiencies from any of the five groups without penalty.  Of these initial four slots, the condottiere is required to spend one to have a proficiency in either direction sense or in weather sense.  Additionally, at second level, a condottiere gains three nonweapon proficiencies in survival, at no cost of proficiency slots, due to their extensive training in multiple environments.  A condottiere may improve nonweapon proficiencies, as other classes may, as described in the Players Handbook.    
 
    To advance in level, a condottiere must be trained by another condottiere of at least 8th level, or of a level at least two levels higher than the level which the trainee is newly achieving, whichever is greater.  At 8th to 12th level, a condottiere may train himself or herself without need of the services of a higher level condottiere, however, he or she must attend a training academy for condottieri during this training.  At 13th level and beyond, a condottiere may train himself or herself regardless of circumstances.
     Due to their intense, extensive training, condottieri save as fighters, but at two levels higher than their actual condottiere level.  In addition, due to their extensive physical and mental discipline, condottieri have superior willpower, and will never be affected by any form of fear, and are 85% immune to beguiling, charm, domination, or possession.  Condottieri are also able to overcome control exerted over them by intelligent weapons 50% of the time due to this.
     Condottieri learn other major skills as well, with the great effectiveness of these skills resulting from extensive education in many varied environments and climates.  These skills are as follows :
     Animal Handling - a condottiere can exercise greater than normal control over any type of animal, with a chance of success equal to 5% per point of wisdom of the condottiere.  Wild animals incur a -25% penalty to this ability, but trained domestic animals which are not hostile apply a bonus of +20%  to this ability.  If the handling check is successful, the reaction of the animal shifts one place in the desired direction; if it fails, the animal becomes one place more hostile.  Animal handling ability does not include the ability to speak with animals.
     Falling - as a result of continuous, extensive training, condottieri are adept at falling safely from heights.  A condottiere will never sustain any damage from a fall of 20 feet or less, and is 25% unlikely to receive damage from a fall from a greater height, assuming that there is some proximate surface for the condottiere to use for controlling his or her descent.  If a condottiere does sustain damage from a fall, the damage sustained is calculated as if the fall were 20 feet less than in actuality.  A condottiere is still subject to the "death from massive damage" rule if he or she takes 50 or more hit points of damage from a fall.
     Horsemanship - a condottiere is arduously educated in the riding of horses and other such mounts, cavalry tactics, and mounted combat continuously.  As a result, a condottiere is 95% unlikely to be thrown from the saddle by sudden actions of the mount, and will never be injured by a fall from any mount.  A condottiere is also 40% unlikely to be forcibly dismounted by a weapon employed against him or her while mounted, and this ability increases by 2% per level above first, to a maximum of 98% at 30th level.
     Survival - every condottiere has the secondary skill of "Expert Survivalist" in their choice of terrain/climate.  This is the only secondary skill that a condottiere may have.
     Tracking - a condottiere has the ability to track outdoors as a ranger of equal level, and the ability to track indoors as a ranger two levels lower than his or her condottiere level.

     = The Dungeon Master may add other skills and/or restrictions as he or she sees fit pertaining to individual condottiere player characters.

       Since condottiere training commences at a very early age, dwarven condottieri are allowed the possibility of possessing a horse as a steed.  This stems from the fact that the dwarf has been trained to suppress his or her fear and distrust of horses at a very early age, and instruction has continued over a period of many years.  Even with this instruction, a dwarf will prefer a more stable, calm mount, and if the player and Dungeon Master agree upon the idea, the dwarven condottiere may have any suitable replacement for the horse as a mount.  Any special mount for a dwarven condottiere will be trained for war.   Note that condottiere training does not suppress a dwarf's aversion to heights or water, and thus, a dwarven condottiere will never have a waterborne or airborne mount.



     Condottieri never summon or hire henchmen, men at arms, soldiers, or mercenaries, however, at 8th level and beyond, a condottiere may train and educate lower level condottieri.  The price paid to the condottiere is variable from one individual to another, however, it should not exceed the average cost of training for level advancement in the area.  A condottiere, regardless of his or her level, may not train any other character class, not even other fighter types.
     At 13th level, or anytime thereafter, a condottiere may establish a training academy for condottieri.  Few actually do this, unless they are greatly renowned in the area in which they intend to build.  This is accomplished by clearing a section of land in a 20 to 50 mile radius of all monsters and other antagonistic beings, and building a fortress within this cleared area.  The fortress will serve as the training academy, and the founding condottiere will receive 500 silver pieces per new student, plus regular training fees.  The founding condottiere also receives 10 copper pieces annual revenue from each citizen living in the area protected by the academy.  Upon establishing such an academy, the condottiere will attract the services of :
            =       1         11th level condottiere, as captain at the academy
            =    1 - 3       9th level condottieri, as instructors at the academy
            =    4 - 8       8th level condottieri, as trainers at the academy
            =  10 - 30    1st to 7th level condottieri, who train at the academy
            =  a full time army of fighters, clerics, magic users, and thieves.  This army keeps order in and guards the academy and surrounding territory from hostile beings, collects revenues, and performs other duties as the founding condottiere sees fit.  These people will all serve faithfully, providing their needs are met, and they receive a just, generous salary.
     After a condottiere has established an academy, no more than 2% of the total income of the academy should be withheld by the founding condottiere as personal income; the remaining amount should be used to maintain the academy and pay the staff.  If the army and the trainers at the academy are not paid well, they will leave and find employment elsewhere.     
     If a condottiere fails to meet the needs of the employees of the academy and loses their support, he or she immediately loses 1975000 experience points, is stripped of all special condottiere abilities, and becomes a fighter, incapable of advancing in level thereafter.  The ex-condottiere also loses the respect, and gains the contempt of all citizens and creatures within a 300 mile radius.  There is a good chance that these people, and possibly the former army will attempt to banish or execute the ex-condottiere.

Prime Requisites :          Strength, Charisma
Races Allowed    :          Human

     A paladin character is a fighter subclass, a noble and heroic warrior, and a symbol of law, order, and the common good.  Unlike normal fighters, all paladins must begin as lawful good in alignment, and always remain lawful good or absolutely lose all of the special powers which are given to them.  They have both fighting abilities and limited spell ability at higher levels.  To become a paladin, a character must be human, and have the following minimum ability scores : Strength 12, Constitution 9, Wisdom 13, Charisma 17.

    11            1050001 - 1400000                9+6

    15            2450001 - 2800000                9+18                                                 
    16            2800001 - 3150000                9+21                                               

= 350000 experience points per level for each level beyond the 16th.
= Paladins gain 3 hit points per level for each level beyond the 9th.

     Lawfulness and good deeds are the meat and drink of a paladin. If a paladin ever knowingly performs a chaotic act, he must seek a high-level (7th or more) cleric of lawful good alignment, confess his sin, and do penance as prescribed by the cleric. If a paladin should ever knowingly and willingly perform an evil act, he loses the status of paladinhood immediately and irrevocably. All benefits are then lost and no deed or magic can restore the character to paladinhood: He is ever after a fighter. The character's level remains unchanged when this occurs and experience points are adjusted accordingly. Thereafter the character is bound by the rules for fighters. He does not gain the benefits of weapon specialization (if this is used) since he did not select this for his character at the start.
     If the paladin commits an evil act while enchanted or controlled by magic, he loses his paladin status until he can atone for the deed. This loss of status means the character loses all his special abilities and essentially functions as a fighter (without weapon specialization) of the same level. Regaining his status undoubtedly requires completion of some dangerous quest or important mission to once again prove his worth and assuage his own guilt. He gains no experience prior to or during the course of this mission, and regains his standing as a paladin only upon completing the quest.

A paladin has the following special benefits:
     A paladin can detect the presence of evil intent up to 60 feet away by concentrating on locating evil in a particular direction. He can do this as often as desired, but each attempt takes one round. This ability detects evil monsters and characters.
     A paladin receives a +2 bonus to all saving throws.
     A paladin is immune to all forms of disease. (Note that certain magical afflictions --lycanthropy and mummy rot --are curses and not diseases.)
     A paladin can heal by laying on hands. The paladin restores 2 hit points per experience level. He can heal himself or someone else, but only once per day.
     A paladin can cure diseases of all sorts (though not cursed afflictions such as lycanthropy). This can be done only once per week for each five levels of experience (once per week at levels 1 through 5, twice per week at levels 6 through 10, etc.).
     A paladin is surrounded by an aura of protection with a 10-foot radius. Within this radius, all summoned and specifically evil creatures suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls, regardless of whom they attack. Creatures affected by this aura can spot its source easily, even if the paladin is disguised.
     A paladin using a holy sword projects a circle of power 10 feet in diameter when the sword is unsheathed and held. This power dispels hostile magic of a level up to the paladin's experience level. (A holy sword is a very special weapon; if your paladin acquires one, the DM will explain its other powers.)
     A paladin gains the power to turn undead and fiends when he reaches 3rd level. He affects these monsters the same as does a cleric two levels lower--for example, at 3rd level he has the turning power of a 1st-level cleric. See the section on clerics for more details on this ability.
     A paladin may call for his war horse upon reaching 4th level, or anytime thereafter. This faithful steed need not be a horse; it may be whatever sort of creature is appropriate to the character (as decided by the DM). A paladin's war horse is a very special animal, bonded by fate to the warrior. The paladin does not really "call" the animal, nor does the horse instantly appear in front of him. Rather, the character must find his war horse in some memorable way, most frequently by a specific quest.
     A paladin can cast cleric spells once he reaches 9th level. He can cast only spells of the combat, divination, healing, and protective spheres. (Spheres are explained in the Cleric section.) The acquisition and casting of these spells abide by the rules given for clerics.
     The spell progression and casting level are listed in Paladin's Table II. Unlike a cleric, the paladin does not gain extra spells for a high Wisdom score. The paladin cannot cast spells from clerical scrolls nor can he use cleric items unless they are allowed to fighters.

	* Maximum spell ability

     A paladin may not possess more than 10 magical items. Furthermore, these may not exceed one suit of armor, one shield, four weapons (arrows and bolts are not counted), and four other magical items.
     A paladin never retains wealth. He may keep only enough treasure to support himself in a modest manner, pay his henchmen, men-at-arms, and servitors a reasonable rate, and to construct or maintain a small castle or keep (funds can be set aside for this purpose). All excess must be donated to the church or another worthy cause. This money can never be given to another player character or NPC controlled by a player.
     A paladin must tithe to whatever charitable, religious institution of lawful good alignment he serves. The tithe must be at least 10% of the paladin's income, whether coins, jewels, magical items, wages, rewards, or taxes. It must be paid immediately.
     A paladin may employ only lawful good henchmen (or those who act in such a manner when alignment is unknown). A paladin will cooperate with characters of other alignments only as long as they behave themselves. He will try to show them the proper way to live through both word and deed. The paladin realizes that most people simply cannot maintain his high standards. Even thieves can be tolerated, provided they are not evil and are sincerely trying to reform. He will not abide the company of those who commit evil or unrighteous acts. Stealth in the cause of good is acceptable, though only as a last resort.




The Ranger :
 
Ability Requirements :	Strength	13
			Constitution	14
			Intelligence	13
			Wisdom		14

Prime Requisites :          Strength, Wisdom
Races Allowed    :          Human, Elf, Half-elf

    Rangers are a subclass of fighter who are adept at woodcraft, tracking,
    scouting, infiltration and spying.  All rangers must be of good alignment,
    although they can be lawful, neutral, or chaotic otherwise.  A ranger must
    have the following minimum ability scores : Strength 13, Constitution 14,
    Intelligence 13, Wisdom 14.
    Rangers have fighting skills like the fighter, but also gain spell ability
    at higher levels, and have other abilities as well. Although the ranger can
    use any weapon and wear any armor, several of his special abilities are
    usable only when he is wearing studded leather or lighter armor.  Although
    he has the basic skills of a fighter, the ranger also has several
    advantages. When wearing studded leather or lighter armor, a ranger can
    fight two-handed with no penalty to his attack rolls (see "Attacking with
    Two Weapons" in Chapter 9: Combat). Obviously, the ranger cannot use a
    shield when fighting this way. A ranger can still fight with two weapons
    while wearing heavier armor than studded leather, but he suffers the
    standard attack roll penalties. The ranger is skilled woodsman. As a
    skilled woodsman, a ranger is adept at tracking. The ranger's skill at
    tracking, however is handled differently from the nonweapon proficiency
    of the same name, and is described below. In addition, while wearing
    studded leather or lighter armor, the ranger has a chance to move silently
    and hide in natural surroundings. The table for this is below. When
    attempting these skills in a non-natural environment ( i.e. city streets),
    the chance of success is halved, and these abilities are not possible in
    heavy armor regardless of location. In their roles as protectors of nature,
    rangers focus in combat against the evil humanoids which have a tendency
    for wanton destruction. They are trained in the habits, combat styles, and
    basic anatomy of humanoid "giant class" creatures so as to be more
    effective against them in combat. When fighting humanoid type creatures
    of the "giant class", rangers add 1 hit point for each level of experience
    they have attained to the points of damage scored when they hit in melee
    combat. This bonus applies per weapon if the ranger is attacking with a
    weapon in each hand.

    An expanded list of humanoid creatures that are considered "giant class",
    qualifying the ranger for a damage bonus (+1 point per level of the ranger)
    when such a creature is engaged in combat, is given below:

        bugbear                     grimlock                  ogrillon                   
        cyclopskin                 half-ogre                orc
        dune stalker               half-orc                  quaggoth
        ettin                            hobgoblin              tasloi 
        flind                            kobold                    troll
        giant                           meazel                     xvart
        gibberling                   norker
        gnoll                            ogre

     Rangers are adept with both tamed and untamed creatures. Having
     experience in nature with many animal types confers a subconscious
     knowledge of basic animal psychology, and a limited animal empathy.
     If a ranger carefully approaches and/or attends to a natural animal,
     he or she can attempt to modify the animal's reactions. When dealing
     with trained or domesticated animals, a ranger can, to a limited degree,
     automatically befriend such an animal. When dealing with a wild animal,
     the animal must make a saving throw versus rods, and if it fails, the
     ranger can modify the creature's reaction one category in the desired
     direction.
     A ranger must always retain a good alignment.  If a ranger should ever
     knowingly and willingly commit an act of evil, he or she is no longer a
     ranger, immediately and irrevocably. All benefits are lost, and no deed
     or magic can restore the character to a ranger.  He or she is everafter
     a fighter, losing enough experience points so that he or she is of the
     same experience level as a fighter as previously as a ranger. The
     character thereafter is treated as a fighter, but without the benefit of
     being able to specialize in a weapon. If a ranger commits an act of evil
     while controlled by magic, ranger status is lost until the character can
     make proper atonement for the deeds. The character functions as a fighter,
     and gains no experience points until the requirements of the atonement
     are made. Furthermore, rangers tend to be isolationists, and independent.
     They will not travel together in groups of more than two rangers ever,
     and will prefer to travel in small groups with other non-ranger types.
     While they can possess any monetary amount of treasure, they will never
     keep more than they can carry. All excess is either converted to a
     portable form, or given away to the ranger's church. Rangers in general
     dislike living in a city or town ( unless they are an urban sort of
     ranger ) and will tend to refuse to stay for long periods of time in one.

Tracking is principally used in outdoor situations, although there are
conditions underground which will enable a ranger to track a creature.
The ranger must have observed the creature to be tracked within 30 minutes of
the commencement of tracking, or have obvious signs of the creature
available, and the ranger must begin tracking at a place where the creature
was observed.

Outdoor Tracking : The base chance to successfully track outdoors is 10% per
level of the ranger, plus an additional 10%.  The base can rise as high as
110%, but can never exceed that figure.  Note that, even in such a case, the
adjusted chance can drop below 100% if negative modifiers are taken into
account.  An adjusted chance of greater than 100% is treated as 100%; that is,
the trail can be followed for as long as the current conditions apply.

Terrain modifiers : 
   Soft enough to hold impressions of the creature being tracked ...................................................+20%
   Allows occasional marks or obvious signs of passage .................................................................+10%
   Allows only infrequent signs of passage due to rock, water, wind, other creatures, etc. ........ ....0%
   Prevents all but the minutest traces of passage .............................................................................. -50%

Other modifiers :
   For each creature being tracked beyond the first in the group being tracked .......................... +02%
   For every 12 hours elapsed since the trail was made .................................................................... -05%
   For every hour of precipitation that has fallen on the trail ........................................................... -25%

If intelligent efforts are made to hide the trail, consider the terrain to be of the next lower category.  If the terrain modifier was already of the -50% category, then tracking is impossible.

Indoor Tracking : Base chance is the same as for outdoor tracking.

Surface or condition modifiers :
   Dirt floor, or unused, dusty area .................................................................................................... +20%
   Wooden floor, or area which allows some occasional indication of passage ........................ ....0%
   Stone floor which prevents all but the minutest traces of passage ........................................... -50%
   
Other modifiers :
   For each creature being tracked beyond the first in the group being tracked ......................... +02%
   For passing over an area where other creatures cross or over track trail ................................... -50%

If intelligent efforts are made to hide the trail, consider the terrain to be of the next lower category.  If the terrain modifier was already of the -50% category, then tracking is impossible.

Special note :  Tracking indoors is impossible if the ranger has never observed some distinguishing characteristic about the tracks of the creature to be tracked, or if the ranger does not observe the quarry making the trail and then follow the tracks within a reasonable amount of time thereafter.  In all cases, the DM must use common sense as to whether or not it will be possible to follow a creature by tracking.  For instance, creatures which leave obvious trails can almost always be tracked; conversely, creatures which do not normally leave any sign of passage are almost impossible to track.  However, since tracking is a combination of visual, audio, and olfactory abilities, tracking might be sometimes possible by unusual means.

Light conditions, indoors or outdoors : All tracking is assumed to be done under conditions of good illumination -- daylight or the equivalent ( i.e.  a continual light spell ).  The movement rate of a ranger while tracking is somewhat slowed, even under optimum conditions; in even poorer conditions, the ranger's movement rate may be reduced drastically.

Identification of tracks :
     Identification of tracks can only occur if the attempt to track is successful.  The chance for successful identification is the same as for tracking.  Identification abilities are cumulative.

        1                                Common woodland creatures tracks and direction of travel
        2                                Common woodland creatures number and pace
        3                                Common woodland creatures time of passage
        4                                As 3rd level; uncommon woodland creatures
        5                                As 3rd level; rare woodland creatures
        6                                As 3rd level; very rare woodland creatures
        7                                As 3rd level; all sorts of  creatures
        8                                As 7th level, plus the ability to determine general size and weight of humans
        9                                As 8th level, plus the ability to determine size and number of mounted
                                           creatures
       10                               As 9th level, pertaining to all creatures ever observed





The Magic User : 

Ability Requirement:	Intelligence 9
Prime Requisite:	Intelligence
Races Allowed:	               Human, Half Elf, Elf

     Magic Users encompass all spellcasters working in the various fields of magic--both those who specialize in specific schools of magic and those who study a broad range of magical theories. Spending their lives in pursuit of arcane wisdom, magic users have little time for physical endeavors. They tend to be poor fighters with little knowledge of weaponry. However, they command powerful and dangerous energies with a few simple gestures, rare components, and mystical words.  Spells are the tools, weapons, and armor of the magic user. He is weak in a toe-to-toe fight, but when prepared he can strike down his foes at a distance, vanish in an instant, become a wholly different creature, or even invade the mind of an enemy and take control of his thoughts and actions. No secrets are safe from a magic user and no fortress is secure. His quest for knowledge and power often leads him into realms where mortals were never meant to go.  Magic users cannot wear any armor, for several reasons. Firstly, most spells require complicated gestures and odd posturings by the caster and armor restricts the wearer's ability to do these properly. Secondly, the magic user spent his youth (and will spend most of his life) learning arcane languages, poring through old books, and practicing his spells. This leaves no time for learning other things (like how to wear armor properly and use it effectively). If the magic user had spent his time learning about armor, he would not have even the meager skills and powers he begins with. There are even unfounded theories that claim the materials in most armors disrupt the delicate fabric of a spell as it gathers energy; the two cannot exist side by side in harmony. While this idea is popular with the common people, true magic users know this is simply not true. If it were, how would they ever be able to cast spells requiring iron braziers or metal bowls?  For similar reasons, magic users are severely restricted in the weapons they can use. They are limited to those that are easy to learn or are sometimes useful in their own research. Hence, a magic user can use a dagger or a staff, items that are traditionally useful in magical studies. Other weapons allowed are darts, knives, and slings (weapons that require little skill, little strength, or both).  Magic users can use more magical items than any other characters. These include potions, rings, wands, rods, scrolls, and most miscellaneous magical items. A magic user can use a magical version of any weapon allowed to his class but cannot use magical armor, because no armor is allowed. Between their spells and magical items, however, magic users wield great power.  Finally, all magic users (whether general practitioners or specialists) can create new magical items, ranging from simple scrolls and potions to powerful staves and magical swords. Once he reaches 7th level, a magic user can pen magical scrolls and brew potions. He can construct more powerful magical items only after he has learned the appropriate spells (or works with someone who knows them).  No matter what school of magic the magic user is involved in, Intelligence is his prime requisite (or one of several prime requisites). Characters must have an Intelligence score of at least 9 to qualify to be a magic user.  All magic users and specialist magic users use the same table for experience levels.

     Learning and casting spells require long study, patience, and research. Once his adventuring life begins, a magic user is largely responsible for his own education; he no longer has a teacher looking over his shoulder and telling him which spell to learn next. This freedom is not without its price, however. It means that the magic user must find his own source for magical knowledge: libraries, guilds, or captured books and scrolls.
     Whenever a magic user discovers instructions for a spell he doesn't know, he can try to read and understand the instructions. The player must roll percentile dice. If the result is equal to or less than the percentage chance to learn a new spell, the character understands the spell and how to cast it. He can enter the spell in his spell book (unless he has already learned the maximum number of spells allowed for that level). If this die roll is higher than the character's chance to learn the spell, he doesn't understand the spell. Once a spell is learned, it cannot be unlearned. It remains part of that character's repertoire forever. Thus, a character cannot choose to "forget" a spell so as to replace it with another.
     A magic user's spell book can be a single book, a set of books, a bundle of scrolls, or anything else your DM allows. The spell book is the magic user's diary, laboratory journal, and encyclopedia, containing a record of everything he knows. Naturally, it is his most treasured possession; without it he is almost helpless.  A spell book contains the complicated instructions for casting the spell -- the spell's recipe, so to speak. Merely reading these instructions aloud or trying to mimic the instructions does not enable one to cast the spell. Spells gather and shape mystical energies; the procedures involved are very demanding, bizarre, and intricate. Before a magic user can actually cast a spell, he must memorize its arcane formula. This locks an energy pattern for that particular spell into his mind. Once he has the spell memorized, it remains in his memory until he uses the exact combination of gestures, words, and materials that triggers the release of this energy pattern. Upon casting, the energy of the spell is spent, wiped clean from the magic user's mind. The magic user cannot cast that spell again until he returns to his spell book and memorizes it again.  Initially the magic user is able to retain only a few of these magical energies in his mind at one time. Furthermore, some spells are more demanding and complex than others; these are impossible for the inexperienced magic user to memorize. With experience, the magic user's talent expands. He can memorize more spells and more complex spells. Still, he never escapes his need to study; the magic user must always return to his spell books to refresh his powers.  Another important power of the magic user is his ability to research new spells and construct magical items. Both endeavors are difficult, time-consuming, costly, occasionally even perilous. Through research, a magic user can create an entirely new spell, subject to the DM's approval. Likewise, by consulting with your DM, your character can build magical items, either similar to those already given in the rules or of your own design.  A magic user may, as an initiate or any time thereafter, become a member of a university of magic.  When a magic user becomes a member, he or she gains the following benefits:
     1 . The magic user may choose a number of his or her own spells equal to one half of the character's intelligence score ( rounded up ), not requiring a "chance to know" roll, and automatically gaining those spells in his or her spell book.
     2 . The magic user may have more than the maximum number of spells specified by the intelligence limit in his or her spell book, however, the magic user can never memorize more than his or her maximum limit as limited by level of experience that the magic user has attained, and maximum spell level as limited by intelligence.
     3 . The magic user may purchase scrolls and other minor magic items from his or her university of magic at reduced cost.  Spell components are also available at reduced cost.
     4 . The cost of training for a magic user who is a member of a university of magic is reduced by at least 25%, perhaps more, when he or she trains at his or her university of magic.  Multi-classed magic users gain this benefit of reduced training cost only for their magic user class.
     The magic user must visit his or her university of magic regularly, at least once per month, and at least once per year on a specific day, as decided upon by the magic user and his or her master, and at any time that the magic user has earned enough experience to allow a gain in level.  The magic user may visit more times per year than this ( and most usually do ), but may not visit less times per year, or he or she will be expelled from the university of magic, and will lose all benefits of being a member thereof.  All magical research conducted by the magic user must be reported to the magic user's master at the university of magic, and all magical research done by the magic user, as well as at least 25% of his or her earnings and other income must be sent to the university of magic, or the master of the university may withhold the offending magic user's privileges until such payment and research is sent to him or her at the university of magic.
 
The Schools of Magic 
	Spells are divided into nine different categories, or schools, according to the types of magical energy they utilize. Each school has its own special methods and practices.
	Although they are called schools, schools of magic are not organized places where a person goes to study. The word "school" identifies a magical discipline. A school is an approach to magic and spellcasting that emphasizes a particular sort of spell. Practitioners of a school of magic may set up a magical university to teach their methods to beginners, but this is not necessary. Many powerful magic users learned their craft studying under reclusive masters in distant lands.
	The nine schools of magic are 
Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning, Enchantment/Charm, Greater Divination, Illusion, Invocation/Evocation, Necromancy, and Lesser Divination.

Magic user Specialist Requirements
									Minimum
									Ability
Specialist		School		Race		Score		Opposition School(s)
Abjurer	Abjuration	H	15 Wis	Alteration & Illusion
Conjurer	Conj./Summ.	H, 1/2 E	15 Con	Gr. Divin. & Evocation
Diviner	Gr. Divin.	H, 1/2 E, E	16 Wis	Conj./Summ.
Enchanter	Ench./Charm	H, 1/2 E, E	16 Cha	Evocation & Necromancy
Illusionist	Illusion	H, G	16 Dex	Necro., Evocation, Abjur.
Invoker	Invoc./Evoc.	H	16 Con	Ench./Charm & Conj./Summ. 
Necromancer	Necromancy	H	16 Wis	Illusion & Ench./Charm
Transmuter	Alteration	H, 1/2 E	15 Dex	Abjuration & Necromancy

	Of these schools, eight are greater schools while the ninth, lesser divination, is a minor school. The minor school of lesser divination includes all divination spells of the 3rd spell level or less (available to all magic users). Greater divinations are those divination spells of the 4th spell or higher.

Specialist Magic Users :
	A magic user who concentrates his effort in a single school of magic is called a specialist. There are specialists in each type of magic, although some are extremely rare. Not all specialists are well-suited to adventuring--the diviner's spells are limited and not generally useful in dangerous situations. On the other hand, player characters might want to consult an NPC diviner before starting an adventure.
	Specialist magic users have advantages and disadvantages when compared to their non-specialist counterparts. Their chance to know spells of their school of magic is greatly increased, but the intensive study results in a smaller chance to know spells outside their school. The number of spells they can cast increases, but they lose the ability to cast spells of the school in opposition to their specialty (opposite it in the diagram). Their ability to research and create new spells within their specialty is increased, but the initial selection of spells in their school may be quite limited. All in all, players must consider the advantages and disadvantages carefully.
	Not all magic users can become specialists. The player character must meet certain requirements to become a specialist. Most specialist magic users must be single-classed; multi-classed characters cannot become specialists, except for gnomes, who seem to have more of a natural bent for the school of illusion than characters of any other race. Dual-class humans can choose to become specialists. The dedication to the particular school of magic requires all the attention and concentration of the character. He does not have time for other class-related pursuits.
	In addition, each school has different restrictions on race, ability scores, and schools of magic allowed. These restrictions are given on the table above. Note that lesser divination is not available as a specialty. The spells of this group, vital to the functioning of a magic user, are available to all magic users.
	Race lists those races that, either through a natural tendency or a quirk of fate, are allowed to specialize in that art. Note that the gnome, though unable to be a regular magic user, can specialize in illusions.
	Minimum Ability Score lists the ability minimums needed to study intensively in that school. All schools require at least the minimum Intelligence demanded of a magic user and an additional prime requisite, as listed.
	Opposition School(s) always includes the school directly opposite the character's school of study in the diagram. In addition, the schools to either side of this one may also be disallowed due to the nature of the character's school. For example, an invoker/evoker cannot learn enchantment/charm or conjuration/summoning spells and cannot use magical items that duplicate spells from these schools.
	Being a specialist does have significant advantages to balance the trade-offs the character must make. These are listed here:
 	A specialist gains one additional spell per spell level, provided the additional spell is taken in the specialist's school. Thus, a 1st-level illusionist could have two spells--one being any spell he knows and the other limited to spells of the illusion school.
 	Because specialists have an enhanced understanding of spells within their school, they receive a +1 bonus when making saving throws against those spells when cast by other magic users. Likewise, other characters suffer a -1 penalty when making saving throws against a specialist casting spells within his school. Both of these modifiers can be in effect at the same time--for example, when an enchanter casts an enchantment spell at another enchanter, the modifiers cancel each other out.
 	Specialists receive a bonus of +15% when learning spells from their school and a penalty of -15% when learning spells from other schools. The bonus or penalty is applied to the percentile dice roll the player must make when the character tries to learn a new spell.
 	Whenever a specialist reaches a new spell level, he automatically gains one spell of his school to add to his spell books. This spell can be selected by the DM or he can allow the player to pick. No roll for learning the spell need be made. It is assumed that the character has discovered this new spell during the course of his research and study.  Specialist magic users are entitled to all the same benefits and strictures as magic users with respect to universities of magic.  They cannot, however, become multi-classed, except for gnomes, who can be multi-classed illusionists.



The Thief : 

Ability Requirement:	Dexterity 9
Prime Requisite:	Dexterity
Races Allowed:	All

	Thieves come in all sizes and shapes, ready to live off the fat of the land by the easiest means possible. In some ways they are the epitome of roguishness.  These are people who feel that the world (and everyone it) somehow owes them a living. They get by day by day, living in the highest style they can afford and doing as little work as possible. The less they have to toil and struggle like everyone else (while maintaining a comfortable standard of living), the better off they think they are. While this attitude is neither evil nor cruel, it does not foster a good reputation. Many a thief has a questionable past or a shady background he'd prefer was left uninvestigated.     All thieves tend to be adept at languages and thus, have a percentage chance to read strange writings they come across. All are skilled in climbing and clinging to small cracks and outcroppings--even more skilled than the hardy men of the mountains. They are alert and attentive, hearing things that others would miss. Finally, they are dexterous (and just a little bit light-fingered), able to perform tricks and filch small items with varying degrees of success.  Thieves have a number of special abilities, such as picking pockets and detecting noise, for which they are given a percentage chance of success (this chance depends on the class, level, Dexterity score, and race of the thief).
	The thief's prime requisite is Dexterity; a character must have a minimum score of 9 to qualify for the class. While high numbers in other scores (particularly Intelligence) are desirable, they are not necessary. The thief can have any alignment except lawful good. Many are at least partially neutral.

= 220000 experience points per level for each level beyond the 16th.
= Thieves and bards gain 2 hit points per level for each level beyond the 10th.

	Thieves have a limited selection of weapons. Most of their time is spent practicing thieving skills. The allowed weapons are club, dagger, dart, hand crossbow, knife, lasso, short bow, sling, bastard sword, broad sword, long sword, short sword, and staff. A thief can wear leather, studded leather, padded, or elven chain armor. When wearing any allowed armor other than leather, the thief's abilities are penalized.
	To determine the initial value of each skill, start with the base scores listed on Thieves Table II. To these base scores, add (or subtract) any appropriate modifiers for race, Dexterity, and armor worn (given on Thieves Tables III, IV, and V, respectively).
	The scores arrived at in the preceding paragraph do not reflect the effort a thief has spent honing his skills. To simulate this extra training, all thieves at 1st level receive 60 discretionary percentage points that they can add to their base scores. No more than 30 points can be assigned to any single skill. Other than this restriction, the player can distribute the points however he wants.
	Each time the thief rises a level in experience, the player receives another 30 points to distribute. No more than 15 points per level can be assigned to a single skill, and no skill can be raised above 95 percent, including all adjustments for Dexterity, race, and armor. As an option, the DM can rule that some portion of the points earned must be applied to skills used during the course of the adventure.

Open Locks	10%
Find/Remove Traps	  5%
Move Silently	10%

	In addition to the base percentages listed above, demihuman characters and characters with high or low Dexterity scores have adjustments to their base numbers. Some characters may find that, after adjustments, they have negative scores. In this case, the character must spend points raising his skill percentage to at least 1% before he can use the skill. (Some races just aren't very good at certain things!)  A thief character uses the "No Armor" column if wearing bracers of defense or a cloak without large or heavy protective clothing.

Skill Explanations
	Pick Pockets: The thief uses this skill when filching small items from other peoples' pockets, sleeves, girdles, packs, etc., when palming items (such as keys), and when performing simple sleight of hand.
	A failed attempt means the thief did not get an item, but it does not mean that his attempt was detected. To determine whether the victim noticed the thief's indiscretion, subtract three times the victim's level from 100. If the thief's pick pockets roll was equal to or greater than this number, the attempt is detected. A 0th-level victim, for example, notices the attempt only if the roll was 00 (100), while a 13th-level character notices the attempt on a dice roll of 61 or more. In some cases, the attempt may succeed and be noticed at the same time.
If the DM wishes, he can rule that a thief of higher level than his victim is less likely to be caught pilfering. The chance that the victim notices the attempt can be modified by subtracting the victim's level from the thief's level, and then adding this number to the percentage chance the thief is detected. A thief can try to pick someone's pocket as many times as he wants. Neither failure nor success prevents additional attempts, but getting caught might!
	Open Locks: A thief can try to pick padlocks, finesse combination locks (if they exist), and solve puzzle locks (locks with sliding panels, hidden releases, and concealed keyholes). Picking a padlock requires tools. Using typical thief's tools grants normal chances for success. Using improvised tools (a bit of wire, a thin dirk, a stick, etc.) imposes a penalty on the character's chance for success. The DM sets the penalty based on the situation; penalties can range from -5 for an improvised but suitable tool, to -60 for an awkward and unsuitable item (like a stick). The amount of time required to pick a lock is 1d10 rounds. A thief can try to pick a particular lock only once per experience level. If the attempt fails, the lock is simply too difficult for the character until he learns more about picking locks (goes up a level).
	Find/Remove Traps: The thief is trained to find small traps and alarms. These include poisoned needles, spring blades, deadly gases, and warning bells. This skill is not effective for finding deadfall ceilings, crushing walls, or other large, mechanical traps.
	To find the trap, the thief must be able to touch and inspect the trapped object. Normally, the DM rolls the dice to determine whether the thief finds a trap. If the DM says, "You didn't find any traps," it's up to the player to decide whether that means there are no traps or there are traps but the thief didn't see them. If the thief finds a trap, he knows its general principle but not its exact nature. A thief can check an item for traps once per experience level. Searching for a trap takes 1d10 rounds.
	Once a trap is found, the thief can try to remove it or disarm it. This also requires 1d10 rounds. If the dice roll indicates success, the trap is disarmed. If the dice roll indicates failure, the trap is beyond the thief's current skill. He can try disarming the trap again when he advances to the next experience level. If the dice roll is 96-100, the thief accidentally triggers the trap and suffers the consequences. Sometimes (usually because his percentages are low) a thief will deliberately spring a trap rather than have unpleasant side effects if the trap doesn't work quite the way the thief thought, and he triggers it while standing in the wrong place.
	This skill is far less useful when dealing with magical or invisible traps. Thieves can attempt to remove these traps, but their chances of success are half their normal percentages.
	Move Silently: A thief can try to move silently at any time simply by announcing that he intends to do so. While moving silently, the thief's movement rate is reduced to 1/3 normal. The DM rolls percentile dice to determine whether the thief is moving silently; the thief always thinks he is being quiet. Successful silent movement improves the thief's chance to surprise a victim, avoid discovery, or move into position to stab an enemy in the back. Obviously, a thief moving silently but in plain view of his enemies is wasting his time.
	Hide in Shadows: A thief can try to disappear into shadows or any other type of concealment -- bushes, curtains, crannies, etc. A thief can hide this way only when no one is looking at him; he remains hidden only as long as he remains virtually motionless. (The thief can make small, slow, careful movements: draw a weapon, uncork a potion, etc.) A thief can never become hidden while a guard is watching him, no matter what his dice roll is--his position is obvious to the guard. However, trying to hide from a creature that is locked in battle with another is possible, as the enemy's attention is fixed elsewhere. The DM rolls the dice and keeps the result secret, but the thief always thinks he is hidden.
	Hiding in shadows cannot be done in total darkness, since the talent lies in fooling the eye as much as in finding real concealment (camouflage, as it were). However, hidden characters are equally concealed to those with or without infravision. Spells, magical items, and special abilities that reveal invisible objects can reveal the location of a hidden thief.
	Detect Noise: A good thief pays attention to every detail, no matter how small, including faint sounds that most others miss. His ability to hear tiny sounds (behind heavy doors, down long hallways, etc.) is much better than the ordinary person's. Listening is not automatic; the thief must stand still and concentrate on what he's hearing for one round. He must have silence in his immediate surroundings and must remove his helmet or hat. Sounds filtering through doors or other barriers are unclear at best.
	Climb Walls: Although everyone can climb rocky cliffs and steep slopes, the thief is far superior to others in this ability. Not only does he have a better climbing percentage than other characters, he can also climb most surfaces without tools, ropes, or devices. Only the thief can climb smooth and very smooth surfaces without climbing gear. Of course, the thief is very limited in his actions while climbing--he is unable to fight or effectively defend himself.
	Read Languages: Out of necessity, thieves tend to learn odd bits of information. Among these is the ability to read various languages, particularly as they apply to treasure maps, deeds, secret notes, and the like. At 4th level, the thief has enough exposure to languages that he has a chance to read most nonmagical writing. This ability naturally improves with more experience. However, your DM can rule that some languages (those the thief has never encountered) are indecipherable to the thief.
	The die roll to read a language must be made every time the character tries to read a document (not just once per language). A successful die roll means the thief puzzled out the meaning of the writing. His understanding of the document is roughly equal to his percentage chance for success: a 20% chance means that, if the thief understands it at all, he gets about 20% of the meaning. A different document in the same language requires another die roll (it probably contains different words). It isn't necessary to keep notes about what languages the thief has read in the past, since each document is handled individually.
	Only one die roll can be made for any particular document at a given experience level. If the die roll fails, the thief can try again after gaining a new experience level.  If the character knows how to read a given language because he spent a proficiency slot on it, this die roll is unnecessary for documents in that language.
	Backstab: Thieves are weak in toe-to-toe hacking matches, but they are masters of the knife in the back. When attacking someone by surprise and from behind, a thief can improve his chance to successfully hit (+4 modifier for rear attack and negate the target's shield and Dexterity bonuses) and greatly increase the amount of damage his blow causes.
	To use this ability, the thief must be behind his victim and the victim must be unaware that the thief intends to attack him. If an enemy sees the thief, hears him approach from a blind side, or is warned by another, he is not caught unaware, and the backstab is handled like a normal attack (although bonuses for a rear attack still apply). Opponents in battle will often notice a thief trying to maneuver behind them--the first rule of fighting is to never turn your back on an enemy! However, someone who isn't expecting to be attacked (a friend or ally, perhaps) can be caught unaware even if he knows the thief is behind him.
	The multiplier given in Thieves Table VI applies to the amount of damage before modifiers for Strength or weapon bonuses are added. The weapon's standard damage is multiplied by the value given in the table, then Strength and magical weapon bonuses are added.
	Backstabbing does have limitations. First, the damage multiplier applies only to the first attack made by the thief, even if multiple attacks are possible. Once a blow is struck, the initial surprise effect is lost. Second, the thief cannot use it on every creature. The victim must be generally humanoid. Part of the skill comes from knowing just where to strike. A thief could backstab an ogre, but he wouldn't be able to do the same to a beholder. The victim must also have a definable back (which leaves out most slimes, jellies, oozes, and the like). Finally, the thief has to be able to reach a significant target area. To backstab a giant, the thief would have to be standing on a ledge or window balcony. Backstabbing him in the ankle just isn't going to be as effective.

Thieves Table VI: Backstab Damage Multipliers

	Thief's Level	                 Damage Multiplier
		1-4			×2
		5-8			×3
		9-12			×4
		13+			×5

	Thieves' Cant: Thieves' cant is a special form of communication known by all thieves and their associates. It is not a distinct language; it consists of slang words and implied meanings that can be worked into any language. The vocabulary of thieves' cant limits its use to discussing things that interest thieves: stolen loot, easy marks, breaking and entering, mugging, confidence games, and the like. It is not a language, however. Two thieves cannot communicate via thieves' cant unless they know a common language. The cant is useful, however, for identifying fellow cads and bounders by slipping a few tidbits of lingo into a normal conversation.
	Use Scrolls: At 10th level, a thief gains a limited ability to use magical and cleric scrolls. A thief's understanding of magical writings is far from complete, however. The thief has a 25% chance to read the scroll incorrectly and reverse the spell's effect. This sort of malfunction is almost always detrimental to the thief and his party. It could be as simple as accidentally casting the reverse of the given spell or as complex as a foul-up on a fireball scroll, causing the ball of flame to be centered on the thief instead of its intended target. The exact effect is up to the DM (this is the sort of thing DMs enjoy, so expect the unexpected).



The Bard : 

Ability Requirements:	Dexterity 12
	Intelligence 13
	Charisma 15
Prime Requisite:	Dexterity, Charisma
Races Allowed:	Human, Half-elf

	The bard is an optional character class that can be used if your DM allows. He makes his way in life by his charm, talent, and wit. A good bard should be glib of tongue, light of heart, and fleet of foot (when all else fails).  To become a bard, a character must have a Dexterity of 12 or more, an Intelligence of 13 or more, and a Charisma of 15 or more. The prime requisites are Dexterity and Charisma. A bard can be lawful, neutral or chaotic, good or evil, but must always be partially neutral. Only by retaining some amount of detachment can he successfully fulfill his role as a bard.
	A bard, by his nature, tends to learn many different skills. He is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. Although he fights as a rogue, he can use any weapon. He can wear any armor up to, and including, chain mail, but he cannot use a shield.
	All bards are proficient singers, chanters, or vocalists and can play a musical instrument of the player's choice (preferably one that is portable). Additional instruments can be learned if the optional proficiency rules are used -- the bard can learn two instruments for every proficiency slot spent.
	In his travels, a bard also manages to learn a few magic user spells. Like a magic user, a bard's Intelligence determines the number of spells he can know and the chance to know any given spell. These he keeps in his spell book, abiding by all the restrictions on memorization and spell use that bind a magic user, especially in the prohibition of armor. Hence, a bard will tend to use his spells more to entertain and impress than to fight. Bards Table II lists the number of spells a bard can cast at each level.

	Since bards are dabblers rather than full-time magic users, their spells tend to be gained by serendipity and happenstance. In no case can a bard choose to specialize in a school of magic. Beginning bards do not have a selection of spells. A 2nd-level bard begins with one to four spells, chosen either randomly or by the DM. (An Intelligence check must still be made to see if the bard can learn a given spell.) The bard is not guaranteed to know read magic, as this is not needed to read the writings in a spell book. The bard can add new spells to his spell book as he finds them, but he does not automatically gain additional spells as he advances in level. All spells beyond those he starts with must be found during the course of adventuring. The bard's casting level is equal to his current level.
	Combat and spells, however, are not the main strength of the bard. His expertise is in dealing and communicating with others. To this end, the bard has a number of special powers. The base percentage for each power is listed on Bards Table III. This base percentage must be adjusted for the race and Dexterity of the bard as given in the Thief description. After all adjustments are made, the player must distribute (however he chooses) 20 additional percentage points to the various special abilities. Thereafter, each time the character advances a level, he receives an additional 15 points to distribute.

Bards Table III: Bard Abilities

	Climb	Detect		Pick		Read
	Walls	Noise		Pockets	               Languages
	50%		20%		10%		5%

	Bard abilities are subject to modifiers for situation and armor as per the thief.
	Climb Walls enables the bard to climb near sheer surfaces without the aid of tools, just like the thief.
	Detect Noise improves the bard's chances of hearing and interpreting sounds. He may be able to overhear parts of a conversation on the other side of a door or pick up the sound of something stalking the party. To use the ability, the bard must stand unhelmeted and concentrate for one round (one minute). During this time, all other party members must remain silent. The DM secretly makes the check and informs the player of the result.
	Pick Pockets enables the bard not only to filch small purses, wallets, keys, and the like, but also to perform small feats of sleight-of-hand (useful for entertaining a crowd). Complete details on pickpocketing (and your character's chances of getting caught) can be found in the Thief description.
	Read Languages is an important ability, since words are the meat and drink of bards. They have some ability to read documents written in languages they do not know, relying on words and phrases they have picked up in their studies and travels. The Read Languages column in the table gives the base percentage chance to puzzle out a foreign tongue. It also represents the degree of comprehension the bard has if he is successful. The DM can rule that a language is too rare or unfamiliar, especially if it has never been previously encountered by the bard, effectively foiling his attempts to translate it. At the other extreme, the bard need not make the dice roll for any language he is proficient in. Success is assumed to be automatic in such cases.
	The bard can also influence reactions of groups of NPCs. When performing before a group that is not attacking (and not intending to attack in just seconds), the bard can try to alter the mood of the listeners. He can try to soften their mood or make it uglier. The method can be whatever is most suitable to the situation at the moment -- a fiery speech, collection of jokes, a sad tale, a fine tune played on a fiddle, a haunting lute melody, or a heroic song from the old homeland. Everyone in the group listening must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation (if the crowd is large, make saving throws for groups of people using average hit dice). The die roll is modified by -1 for every three experience levels of the bard (round fractions down). If the saving throw fails, the group's reaction can be shifted one level (see the Reactions section in the DMG), toward either the friendly or hostile end of the scale, at the player's option. Those who make a successful saving throw have their reaction shifted one level toward the opposite end of the scale.
	This ability cannot affect people in the midst of battle; it is effective only when the audience has time to listen. If a bard were to try telling his tale while the bandits were attacking his group, the bandits would have quickly decided that he was a fool and carried on with their business. Furthermore, the form of entertainment used must be appropriate to the audience. A bard might be able to calm (or enrage) a bear with music, but he won't have much luck telling jokes to orcs unless he speaks their language.
	The music, poetry, and stories of the bard can also be inspirational, rallying friends and allies. If the exact nature of an impending threat is known, the bard can heroically inspire his companions (immortalizing them in word and song), granting a +1 bonus to attack rolls, or a +1 bonus to saving throws, or a +2 bonus to morale (particularly useful in large battles) to those involved in melee. The bard must spend at least three full rounds singing or reciting before the battle begins. This affects those within a range of 10 feet per experience level of the bard.  The effect lasts one round per level. Once the effect wears off, it can't be renewed if the recipients are still in battle. However, troops who have withdrawn from combat can be reinspired by the bard's words.
	Bards are also able to counter the effects of songs and poetry used as magical attacks. Characters within 30 feet of the bard are immune to the attack as long as the bard sings a counter song (or recites a poem, etc.). While doing this, the bard can perform no other action except a slow walk. Furthermore, if he is struck or fails a saving throw, his effort is ruined. Success is checked by having the bard make a saving throw vs. spell. Success blocks the attack, failure means the attack has its normal effect (everyone affected rolls saving throws, normal damage is inflicted, etc.). The bard can use this ability once per encounter or battle. This power does not affect verbal spell components or command words; it is effective against spells that involve explanations, commands, or suggestions.
	Finally, bards learn a little bit of everything in their studies and travels. Thus, all bards can read and write their native tongue (if a written language exists) and all know local history (without cost if the optional proficiency rules are used). Furthermore, bards have a 5% chance per experience level to identify the general purpose and function of any magical item. The bard need not handle the item but must examine it closely. Even if successful, the exact function of the item is not revealed, only its general nature.
	Upon reaching 10th level, a bard can attempt to use magical devices of written nature--scrolls, books, etc. However, his understanding of magic is imperfect (although better than that of a thief), so there is a 15% chance that any written item he uses is read incorrectly. When this happens, the magical power works the opposite of what is intended, generally to the detriment of the bard or his friends. The DM will tell you what happens to your character, based on the situation and particular magical item. The result may be unpleasant, deadly, or embarrassing. (Deciding these things is part of the DM's fun!)



The Monk :

Ability Requirements :  Strength        12  
                                          Dexterity       12
                                          Constitution  12
                                          Wisdom        17   
Prime Requisites :          None 
Races Allowed    :          Human


     The monk is a specialized cleric subclass whose primary focus is self discipline and tolerance.  Unlike the standard cleric types, they hold reverence for the pantheon as a whole rather than have a specific patron deity.  The monk's self focus and expanded religious beliefs gives the monk vastly different skills and abilities than those of  the cleric.  In order to become a monk, a character must be human, and have the following minimum ability scores: Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 12, and Wisdom 17.  There is no prime requisite for the monk, and therefore, the monk does not gain experience point bonuses for exceptional abilities.  The monk does, however, gain the applicable bonuses if he or she has a high enough strength score and/or dexterity score.
     Due to the discipline required, a monk must be lawful, but may be good, neutral, or evil otherwise.  A monk who changes from a lawful alignment becomes a fighter without benefit of weapon specialization, and with the same number of experience points (which may result in a lesser level as a fighter).  A fallen monk loses all special monk abilities, and can never regain monk status.

= 225000 experience points per level for each level beyond the 16th.
= Monks gain 2 hit points per level for each level beyond the 9th.
= Monks do not advance in level beyond the 19th.

     Monks use the same combat tables as do clerics, and make saving throws as clerics.  They are not allowed to use any type of armor, but due to their intense training, gain the ability of a natural armor class according to Monks Table II below.  The monk begins with two weapon proficiencies, and like the cleric learns one additional for every four experience levels attained.  Their selection of weaponry is limited to hand axe, club, dagger, blowgun, halberd, all types of hammers, short sword, palspar, spear, and staff.  The primary fighting style of the monk however, is a specialized form of unarmed combat where the monk uses his hands and feet as weapons.  The information regarding the unarmed combat is given on Monks Table II.  In addition to unarmed combat, the monk learns other abilities which are listed on Monks Table II and described thereafter.

Special Ability Description:

   A: Beginning at 1st level, the monk gains the ability to dodge or knock aside any hand hurled missile weapon used against the monk, to a maximum limit of four such missiles.  In order to be successful, the monk must make a saving throw versus petrification for each missile to be avoided in this manner.  Device propelled missiles such as arrows and crossbow bolts cannot be avoided, but such things as javelins and spears can be.
   B:  At 4th level a monk learns the ability to mask the mind so that ESP has only a 30% chance of success.  With each level of experience which the monk gains thereafter, the chance of success of ESPing the monk's thoughts drops by 2%, i.e. 28% at 5th level, 26% at 6th level, etc.
   C: At 6th level and beyond, the ability to use self-induced catalepsy to appear dead. This can be done perfectly, as the monk is able to lower his or her body temperature and heart rate. The monk is able to maintain this state for twice the number of turns as the monk's level.
   D: A 7th or higher level monk is immune to the effects of haste and slow spells and magical effects which duplicate these spells. 
   E: At 8th level and beyond, the monk is less affected by age, so that the physiological age of the monk is as though he or she were affected by a phylactery of long years.

   F: At 9th level, the monk is 50% resistant to beguiling, charm, hypnosis, and suggestion.  This resistance increases by 5% per level, so that at 10th level, the monk is 55% resistant, 60% at 11th, and so on.
   G: At 11th level and beyond, the monk is not subject to diseases of any sort.
   H: Starting at 12th level, in unarmed combat, the monk is able to affect creatures which require a +1 or lesser magical weapon to hit.
   I: At 14th level, the monk gains immunity to poisons.
   J: Starting at 15th level, in unarmed combat, the monk is able to affect creatures which require a +2 or lesser magical weapon to hit.  
   K: A 16th or higher level monk can not be affected by geas or quest spells.
   L: The last ability gained, and perhaps the most terrible power, is the fabled attack which enables the monk to set up vibrations in the body of the victim, and the monk can then control such vibrations so as to cause death to occur when the monk stops them.  Known as the "quivering palm", the monk merely touches his victim to set up the deadly vibrations.  The victim can be virtually any creature.  This power is limited as follows: 
          1. It can be attempted but once per week, and the monk must touch the intended victim within three melee rounds, or the power is drained for one week.
         2. It has no effect on the undead or creatures which can be hit only by magical weaponry.
         3. The victim cannot have more hit dice than the monk using the power, and in any event the total hit points of the victim cannot exceed those of the monk by more than 200%, or the power has no effect.
         4. The command to die (the control of the vibration) must be given by the monk within a set time limit, or else the vibrations simply cease of their own accord and do no damage whatsoever.  The time limit of death command is one day per level of experience the monk has gained at the time the power is used.

     Monks follow the rules for non-weapon proficiencies as do clerics, starting with 4 slots at first level and gaining 1 additional slot for every 3 experience levels they attain thereafter.  Of these initial four nonweapon proficiency slots, the monk is required to have proficiency in religion.
      Monks have limited clerical spell ability as well, and receive spells at a rate as per Monks Table II, above.  Monks do not gain spell bonuses for high wisdom scores.  Upon attaining second level, the monk chooses three clerical spheres of influence for spells.  These three, plus the "All" sphere, are the spheres of influence from which the monk will thereafter receive spells.  Once selected the monk's spheres of influence will never change and the monk will never gain additional spheres of influence.   
    The monk also gains limited thieving skills.  At first level, the monk chooses three abilities from pick pockets, open locks, find and remove traps, move silently, hide in shadows, detect noise, climb walls, and read languages. The monk will only ever have three of these, and once selected the monk may never change or gain additional thief abilities.  The rate at which the chosen areas advance on Table 19: Thief Average Ability Table on page 23 of the 2nd edition Dungeon Master's Guide.


Multi-Class and Dual-Class Characters : 
     A multi-class character improves in two or more classes simultaneously.  Experience points are assigned as the DM sees fit.  In general, more experience will go to the class in which your character practices more. The available class combinations vary according to race. The character can use the abilities of both classes at any time, with only a few restrictions. Only demihumans can be multi-class characters.
	A dual-class character is one who starts with a single class, advances to moderate level, and then changes to a second character class and starts over again. The character retains the benefits and abilities of the first class but never again earns experience for using them. There are some limitations on combining the abilities of the two classes but, as long as minimum ability and alignment requirements are met, there are no restrictions on the possible character class combinations. Only humans can be dual-class characters.
     Allowable multi-class combinations are detailed for each character race in the "Character Races" section of this text, and repeated here for ease of reference.  Half-elves who are multi-classed in three classes cannot take any subclasses in the multi-class combination.  Note that there may be restrictions regarding multi-class clerics, depending upon the chosen patron deity, as certain deities do not allow their clerics to be multi-classed, or limit multi-class choices.  See the specific descriptions in Appendix I.
     Dwarf - Multi-Class Combinations : Cleric/Fighter; Cleric/Thief; Fighter/Thief
     Elf - Multi-Class Combinations : Fighter/Magic User, Fighter/Thief, Ranger/Magic User, Ranger/Thief, Magic User/Thief
     Gnome - Multi-Class Combinations : Cleric/Fighter, Cleric/Illusionist, Cleric/Thief, Fighter/Illusionist, Fighter/Thief, Illusionist/Thief
     Half-Elf - Multi-Class Combinations : Cleric/Fighter, Cleric/Ranger, Cleric/Magic User, Cleric/Thief, Fighter/Magic User, Fighter/Thief, Ranger/Magic User, Ranger/Thief, Magic User/Thief, Cleric/Fighter/Magic User, Cleric/Fighter/Thief, Cleric/Magic User/Thief, Fighter/Magic User/Thief
     Halfling - Multi-Class Combinations : Cleric/Thief, Fighter/Thief      
     Human - Multi-Class Combinations : none
	As stated earlier in their description, specialist magic users cannot be multi-class (gnome illusionists are the single exception to this rule). The required devotion to their single field prevents specialist magic users from applying themselves to other classes. Clerics of a specific mythos might be allowed as a multi-class option; this will depend on the nature of the mythos as determined by the DM.

Multi-Class Benefits and Restrictions 
The character's hit points are the average of all his Hit Dice rolls. When the character is first created, the player rolls hit points for each class separately, totals them up, then divides by the number of dice rolled (round fractions down). Any Constitution bonus is then added to the character's hit points. If one of the character's classes is fighter and he has a Constitution of 17 or 18, then he gains the +3 or +4 Constitution bonus available only to warriors (instead of the +2 maximum available to the other character classes).  Later the character is likely to gain levels in different classes at different times. When this happens, roll the appropriate Hit Die and divide the result by the number of classes the character has (round fractions down, but a Hit Die never yields less than 1 hit point). The character's Constitution bonus is split between his classes.  If the optional proficiency system is used, the character starts with the largest number of proficiency slots of the different classes. Thereafter, he gains new proficiency slots at one per three total levels the character. 
	Multi-class characters can combine abilities from their different classes with the following restrictions:
	Cleric: Regardless of his other classes, a multi-classed cleric must abide by the weapon restrictions of his mythos.  He retains all his normal cleric abilities.
	Fighter: A multi-classed fighter or fighter subclass can use all of his abilities without restriction. The fighter abilities form the base for other character classes.
	Magic User: Multi-classed magic users may wear any type of armor which the character's other class allows, but may not wear any armor while casting any magic user spell, with the exception that a multi-classed elven magic user ( and only a multi-classed elven magic user ) may cast magic user spells while wearing elven chain mail, so long as the armor is permitted by the character's other class.
	Thief: A multi-classed thief cannot use any thieving abilities other than open locks or detect noise if he is wearing armor that is normally not allowed to thieves. He must remove his gauntlets to open locks and his helmet to detect noise.

Dual-Class Benefits and Restrictions 
	Only humans can be dual-classed characters. To be dual-classed, the character must have scores of 15 or more in the prime requisites of his first class and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of any classes he switches to. The character selects one class to begin his adventuring life. He can advance in this class as many levels as he desires before switching to another class; there is no cut-off point beyond which a character cannot switch. However, he must attain at least 2nd level in his current class before changing to another class. There is no limit to the number of classes a character can acquire, as long as he has the ability scores and wants to make the change. (Certain character classes have alignment restrictions that the character must meet, however.)
	Any time after reaching 2nd level, a human character can enter a new character class, provided he has scores of 17 or better in the prime requisites of the new class. After switching to a new class, the character no longer earns experience points in his previous character class and he can no longer advance in level in that class. Nor can he switch back to his first class at a later date, hoping to resume his advancement where he left off. Once he leaves a class he has finished his studies in it. Instead, he starts over in a new class, at 1st level with 0 experience points, but he does retain his previous Hit Dice and hit points. He gains the abilities, and must abide by all of the restrictions, of the new class. He does not gain or lose any points on his ability scores (for example, an 18 Strength magic user who changes to fighter does not gain the percentile Strength bonus, but likewise a fighter changing to a magic user would not lose it). The character uses the combat and saving throw tables appropriate to his new class and level.
	This is not to imply that a dual-class human forgets everything he knew before; he still has, at his fingertips, all the knowledge, abilities, and proficiencies of his old class. But if he uses any of his previous class's abilities during an encounter, he earns no experience for that encounter and only half experience for the adventure. The only values that can be carried over from the previous class without restriction are the character's Hit Dice and hit points. The character is penalized for using his old attack or saving throw numbers, weapons or armor that are now prohibited, and any special abilities of the old class that are not also abilities of the new class. (The character is trying to learn new ways to do things; by slipping back to his old methods, he has set back his learning in his new character class.)
	In addition, the character earns no additional Hit Dice or hit points while advancing in his new class.
	The restrictions in the previous two paragraphs last until the character reaches a higher level in his new class than his maximum level in any of his previous classes. At that point, both restrictions are dropped: the character gains the abilities of his previous classes without jeopardizing his experience points for the adventure, and he earns additional Hit Dice (those of his new class) and hit points for gaining experience levels in his new class.
	Once these restrictions are lifted, the character must still abide by the restrictions of whichever class he is using at the moment. A dual-class fighter/magic user, for example, cannot cast spells while wearing armor.
	When a dual-class or multi-class character is struck by a level-draining creature, he first loses levels in the class in which he has advanced the highest. When his different classes are equal in level, the class level requiring the most experience points is lost first.
	The player character is allowed to regain levels lost by level draining, but until he regains all of his former levels, he must select which class he will use prior to any particular adventure. Using abilities of the other class then subjects him to the experience penalties given earlier. When he regains all of his former levels, he is then free to use all the abilities of all his classes once again. Of course, he cannot raise his earlier class(es) above the level(s) he was at when he switched class.





Chapter 4: 
Alignment 

     After all other steps toward creating a character have been completed, the player must choose an alignment for the character. In some cases (especially the paladin), the choice of alignment may be limited.
	The character's alignment is a guide to his basic moral and ethical attitudes toward others, society, good, evil, and the forces of the universe in general. Use the chosen alignment as a guide to provide a clearer idea of how the character will handle moral dilemmas. Always consider alignment as a tool, not a straitjacket that restricts the character. Although alignment defines general attitudes, it certainly doesn't prevent a character from changing his beliefs, acting irrationally, or behaving out of character.
	Alignment is divided into two sets of attitudes: order and chaos, and good and evil. By combining the different variations within the two sets, nine distinct alignments are created. These nine alignments serve well to define the attitudes of most of the people in the world.

Law, Neutrality, and Chaos 
Attitudes toward order and chaos are divided into three opposing beliefs. Picture these beliefs as the points of a triangle, all pulling away from each other. The three beliefs are law, chaos, and neutrality. One of these represents each character's ethos--his understanding of society and relationships.
	Characters who believe in law maintain that order, organization, and society are important, indeed vital, forces of the universe. The relationships between people and governments exist naturally. Lawful philosophers maintain that this order is not created by man but is a natural law of the universe. Although man does not create orderly structures, it is his obligation to function within them, lest the fabric of everything crumble. For less philosophical types, lawfulness manifests itself in the belief that laws should be made and followed, if only to have understandable rules for society. People should not pursue personal vendettas, for example, but should present their claims to the proper authorities. Strength comes through unity of action, as can be seen in guilds, empires, and powerful churches.
	Those espousing neutrality tend to take a more balanced view of things. They hold that for every force in the universe, there is an opposite force somewhere. Where there is lawfulness, there is also chaos; where there is neutrality, there is also partisanship. The same is true of good and evil, life and death. What is important is that all these forces remain in balance with each other. If one factor becomes ascendant over its opposite, the universe becomes unbalanced. If enough of these polarities go out of balance, the fabric of reality could pull itself apart. For example, if death became ascendant over life, the universe would become a barren wasteland.
	Philosophers of neutrality not only presuppose the existence of opposites, but they also theorize that the universe would vanish should one opposite completely destroy the other (since nothing can exist without its opposite). Fortunately for these philosophers (and all sentient life), the universe seems to be efficient at regulating itself. Only when a powerful, unbalancing force appears (which almost never happens) need the defenders of neutrality become seriously concerned.
	The believers in chaos hold that there is no preordained order or careful balance of forces in the universe. Instead they see the universe as a collection of things and events, some related to each other and others completely independent. They tend to hold that individual actions account for the differences in things and that events in one area do not alter the fabric of the universe halfway across the galaxy. Chaotic philosophers believe in the power of the individual over his own destiny and are fond of anarchistic nations. Being more pragmatic, non-philosophers recognize the function of society in protecting their individual rights. Chaotics can be hard to govern as a group, since they place their own needs and desires above those of society.

Good, Neutrality, and Evil 
Like law and order, the second set of attitudes is also divided into three parts. These parts describe, more or less, a character's moral outlook; they are his internal guideposts to what is right or wrong.
	Good characters are just that. They try to be honest, charitable, and forthright. People are not perfect, however, so few are good all the time. There are always occasional failings and weaknesses. A good person, however, worries about his errors and normally tries to correct any damage done.
	Remember, however, that goodness has no absolute values. Although many things are commonly accepted as good (helping those in need, protecting the weak), different cultures impose their own interpretations on what is good and what is evil.
	Those with a neutral moral stance often refrain from passing judgment on anything. They do not classify people, things, or events as good or evil; what is, is. In some cases, this is because the creature lacks the capacity to make a moral judgment (animals fall into this category). Few normal creatures do anything for good or evil reasons. They kill because they are hungry or threatened. They sleep where they find shelter. They do not worry about the moral consequences of their actions--their actions are instinctive.
	Evil is the antithesis of good and appears in many ways, some overt and others quite subtle. Only a few people of evil nature actively seek to cause harm or destruction. Most simply do not recognize that what they do is destructive or disruptive. People and things that obstruct the evil character's plans are mere hindrances that must be overcome. If someone is harmed in the process . . . well, that's too bad. Remember that evil, like good, is interpreted differently in different societies.

Alignment Combinations 
Nine different alignments result from combining these two sets. Each alignment varies from all others, sometimes in broad, obvious ways, and sometimes in subtle ways. Each alignment is described in the following paragraphs.
	Lawful Good: Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society with a well-organized government can work to make life better for the majority of the people. To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed. When people respect the laws and try to help one another, society as a whole prospers. Therefore, lawful good characters strive for those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the most people and cause the least harm. An honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and wise king, or a stern but forthright minister of justice are all examples of lawful good people.
	Lawful Neutral: Order and organization are of paramount importance to characters of this alignment. They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether that government is a tyranny or benevolent democracy. The benefits of organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by their actions. An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of lawful neutral behavior.
	Lawful Evil: These characters believe in using society and its laws to benefit themselves. Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant. To this end, lawful evil characters support laws and societies that protect their own concerns. If someone is hurt or suffers because of a law that benefits lawful evil characters, too bad. Lawful evil characters obey laws out of fear of punishment. Because they may be forced to honor an unfavorable contract or oath they have made, lawful evil characters are usually very careful about giving their word. Once given, they break their word only if they can find a way to do it legally, within the laws of the society. An iron-fisted tyrant and a devious, greedy merchant are examples of lawful evil beings.
	Neutral Good: These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the concerns of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good. Since the universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it may even maintain it. If fostering good means supporting organized society, then that is what must be done. If good can only come about through the overthrow of existing social order, so be it. Social structure itself has no innate value to them. A baron who violates the orders of his king to destroy something he sees as evil is an example of a neutral good character.
	True Neutral: True neutral characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and they refuse to see actions as either good or evil. Since the majority of people in the world make judgments, true neutral characters are extremely rare. True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the forces of either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their duty to see that all of these forces remain in balanced contention.
	True neutral characters sometimes find themselves forced into rather peculiar alliances. To a great extent, they are compelled to side with the underdog in any given situation, sometimes even changing sides as the previous loser becomes the winner. A true neutral druid might join the local barony to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop out or switch sides when the gnolls were brought to the brink of destruction. He would seek to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Clearly, there are very few true neutral characters in the world.
	Neutral Evil: Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and their own advancement. They have no particular objection to working with others or, for that matter, going it on their own. Their only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy way to gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously illegal, they take advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters, they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions for personal gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays people to the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical examples of neutral evil characters.
	Chaotic Good: Chaotic good characters are strong individualists marked by a streak of kindness and benevolence. They believe in all the virtues of goodness and right, but they have little use for laws and regulations. They have no use for people who "try to push folk around and tell them what to do." Their actions are guided by their own moral compass which, although good, may not always be in perfect agreement with the rest of society. A brave frontiersman forever moving on as settlers follow in his wake is an example of a chaotic good character.
	Chaotic Neutral: Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.
	Chaotic Evil: These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized. Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for themselves. The strong have the right to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by a desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies. Such a group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of bullying his underlings into obedience. Since leadership is based on raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.

Non-Aligned Creatures 
	In addition to the alignments above, some things--particularly unintelligent monsters (killer plants, etc.) and animals--never bother with moral and ethical concerns. For these creatures, alignment is simply not applicable. A dog, even a well-trained one, is neither good nor evil, lawful nor chaotic. It is simply a dog. For these creatures, alignment is always detected as neutral.

Changing Alignment 
Alignment is a tool, not a straitjacket. It is possible for a player to change his character's alignment after the character is created, either by action or choice. However, changing alignment is not without its penalties.
	Most often the character's alignment will change because his actions are more in line with a different alignment. This can happen if the player is not paying attention to the character and his actions. The character gradually assumes a different alignment. For example, a lawful good fighter ignores the village council's plea for help because he wants to go fight evil elsewhere. This action is much closer to chaotic good, since the character is placing his desire over the need of the community. The fighter would find himself beginning to drift toward chaotic good alignment.
	All people have minor failings, however, so the character does not instantly become chaotic good. Several occasions of lax behavior are required before the character's alignment changes officially. During that time, extremely lawful good activities can swing the balance back. Although the player may have a good idea of where the character's alignment lies, only the DM knows for sure.
	Likewise, the character cannot wake up one morning and say, "I think I'll become lawful good today." (Well, he can say it, but it won't have any effect.) A player can choose to change his character's alignment, but this change is accomplished by deeds, not words. Tell the DM of the intention and then try to play according to the new choice.
	Finally, there are many magical effects that can change a character's alignment. Rare and cursed magical items can instantly alter a character's alignment. Powerful artifacts may slowly erode a character's determination and willpower, causing subtle shifts in behavior. Spells can compel a character to perform actions against his will. Although all of these have an effect, none are as permanent or damaging as those choices the character makes of his own free will.
	Changing the way a character behaves and thinks will cost him experience points and slow his advancement. Part of a character's experience comes from learning how his own behavior affects him and the world around him. In real life, for example, a person learns that he doesn't like horror movies only by going to see a few of them. Based on that experience, he learns to avoid certain types of movies. Changing behavior means discarding things the character learned previously. Relearning things takes time. This costs the character experience.
	There are other, more immediate effects of changing alignment. Certain character classes require specific alignments. A paladin who is no longer lawful good is no longer a paladin. A character may have magical items usable only to specific alignments (intelligent swords, etc.). Such items don't function (and may even prove dangerous) in the hands of a differently aligned character.
	News of a character's change in behavior will certainly get around to friends and acquaintances. Although some people he never considered friendly may now warm to him, others may take exception to his new attitudes. A few may even try to help him "see the error of his ways." The local clergy, on whom he relies for healing, may look askance on his recent behavior, denying him their special services (while at the same time sermonizing on his plight). The character who changes alignment often finds himself unpopular, depending on the attitudes of the surrounding people. People do not understand him. If the character drifts into chaotic neutral behavior in a highly lawful city, the townspeople might decide that the character is afflicted and needs close supervision, even confinement, for his own good!
	Ultimately, the player is advised to pick an alignment he can play comfortably, one that fits in with those of the rest of the group, and he should stay with that alignment for the course of the character's career. There will be times when the DM, especially if he is clever, creates situations to test the character's resolve and ethics. But finding the right course of action within the character's alignment is part of the fun and challenge of role-playing.




Chapter 5:
Proficiencies

Most of what a player character can do is defined by his race, class, and ability scores. These three characteristics don't cover everything, however. Characters can have a wide range of talents, from the potent (and intricate) arts of magic to the simple and mundane knowledge of how to build a good fire. The character's magical ability (or lack thereof) is defined by his class. Lesser abilities, such as fire building, are defined by proficiencies.
	A proficiency is a learned skill that isn't essential to the character's class. A ranger, for example, may find it useful to know something about navigation, especially if he lives near an ocean or sea coast. On the other hand, he isn't likely to suffer if he doesn't know how to navigate; he is a ranger, not a sailor.
	Proficiencies are divided into two groups: weapon proficiencies (those related to weapons and combat) and nonweapon proficiencies (those related to everything else).
     Proficiencies are handled relatively simply.   Weapon proficiencies, nonweapon proficiencies, and secondary skills are used.  All characters have weapon and nonweapon proficiencies, but not all, and in fact very few will have a secondary skill.  Weapon proficiencies are handled the same way that they have been since 1978.  Weapon specialization is handled a bit differently than in the established books, and is described below.   Nonweapon proficiencies are altered from the Players Handbook tables, as I decided that there was need  for some new proficiencies, and a rearrangement of the groups.  All classes gain additional nonweapon proficiencies at the same rate of one additional proficiency slot for every three experience levels.   The new tables are presented below, as well as the new proficiencies for which I saw a need.

Acquiring Proficiencies 
Even newly created, 1st-level characters have proficiencies. The number of proficiency slots that a character starts with is determined by his group, as shown in the table above. Each proficiency slot is empty until the player "fills" it by selecting a proficiency.  Once a proficiency slot is filled, it can never be changed or reassigned.  Thereafter, as the character advances in experience levels, he gains additional proficiency slots. The rate at which he gains them depends on the class he belongs to.

Training 
Like all skills and abilities, proficiencies do not leap unbidden and fully realized into a character's mind. Instead, a character must train, study, and practice to learn a new proficiency. However, role-playing the training time needed to learn a new skill is not much fun. Thus, there are no training times or study periods associated with any proficiency. When a character chooses a proficiency, it is assumed that he had been studying it in his spare time.
	Consider just how much spare time the character has. The player is not role-playing every second of his character's life. The player may decide to have his character spend a night in town before setting out on the long journey the next day. Perhaps the character must wait around for several days while his companions heal from the last adventure. Or he might spend weeks on an uneventful ocean voyage. What is he doing during that time?
	Among other things, he is studying whatever new proficiencies he will eventually learn. Using this "down time" to handle the unexciting aspects of a role-playing campaign lets players concentrate on more important (or more interesting) matters.  Another part of training is finding a teacher. Most skills are easier to learn if someone teaches the character. The DM can handle this in several ways. For those who like simplicity, ignore the need for teachers--there are self-taught people everywhere in the world. For those who want more complexity, make the player characters find someone to teach them any new proficiency they want to learn. This can be another player character or an NPC. Although this adds realism, it tends to limit the PC's adventuring options, especially if he is required to stay in regular contact with his instructor. Furthermore, most teachers want payment. While a barter arrangement might be reached, the normal payment is cash. The actual cost of the service depends on the nature of the skill, the amount of training desired, the availability of tutors, the greed of the instructor, and the desire of the DM to remove excess cash from his campaign.

Weapon Proficiencies 
A weapon proficiency measures a character's knowledge and training with a specific weapon. When a character is created, the player checks the table above to see how many weapon proficiency slots the character has. These initial slots must be filled immediately, before the character embarks on his first adventure. Any slots that aren't filled by then are lost.  Each weapon proficiency slot must be assigned to a particular weapon, not just a class of weapons. Each weapon  requires its own proficiency; each has its own special tricks and quirks that must be mastered before the weapon can be handled properly and effectively. A fencer who is master of the epee, for example, is not necessarily skilled with a saber; the two weapons look similar, but the fighting styles they are designed for are entirely different. A player character could become proficient with a long bow or a short bow, but not with all bows in general (unless he devotes a proficiency slot to each individually). Furthermore, a character can assign weapon proficiency slots only to those weapons allowed to his character class.  As a character reaches higher experience levels, he also earns additional weapon proficiencies. The rate at which proficiencies are gained depends on the character's class. Warriors, who concentrate on their martial skills, learn to handle a great number of weapons. They gain weapon proficiencies quickly. Magic users, who spend their time studying forgotten magical arts, have little time to practice with weapons. They gain additional weapon proficiencies very slowly. Multi-class characters can use the most beneficial line on the proficiencies table to determine their initial proficiencies.

Effects of Weapon Proficiencies 
	A character who has a specific weapon proficiency is skilled with that weapon and familiar with its use. A character does not gain any bonuses for using a weapon he is proficient with; the combat rules and attack chances assume that everyone uses a weapon he is proficient with. This eliminates the need to add a modifier to every die roll during battle.  When a character uses a weapon that he is not proficient with, however, he suffers a penalty on his chance to hit. The size of this penalty depends on the character's class. Warriors have the smallest penalty because they are assumed to have passing familiarity with all weapons. Magic users, by comparison, are heavily penalized because of their limited study of weapons.

Related Weapons Bonus 
	When a character gains a weapon proficiency, he is learning to use a particular weapon effectively. However, many weapons have similar characteristics. A long sword, bastard sword, and broad sword, while all different, are all heavy, slashing swords. A character who is trained with one can apply some of his skill to the others. He is not fully proficient with the weapon, but he knows more about it than someone who picks it up without any skill in similar weapons.  When a character uses a weapon that is similar to a weapon he is proficient with, his attack penalty is only one-half the normal amount (rounded up). A warrior, for example, would have a -1 penalty with a related weapon instead of -2. A magic user would have a -3 penalty instead of -5.
	Specific decisions about which weapons are related are left to the DM.



Weapon Specialization 
	Knowing how to use a weapon without embarrassing yourself is very different from being a master of that weapon. There are warriors, and then there are martial artists. An Olympic fencer is more than just an athlete; he can do things with his weapon that astound most fencers.  In the AD&D game, part of your character's skill is reflected in the bonuses he earns as he reaches higher levels. As your character advances, he becomes a wiser, more dangerous fighter. Experience has taught him to anticipate his opponents and to pounce on any advantage that presents itself. But this is a general, overall improvement, brought about by the fighter's sharpening senses and timing. It applies equally to all types of fighting.
     Only members of the fighter class can make use of weapon specialization; it is not available to any other class, not even condottieri, paladins, or rangers.  Furthermore, the fighter must be single-classed; multi-classed fighters can not have weapon specialization either.  This discipline is manifested in the character's choice of one weapon to practice and use, to the point where most of his or her time training with weapons is spent on the weapon of specialization.  If weapon specialization is to be practiced by the fighter, that character must have a minimum intelligence of 12, after all, you have to be intelligent enough to know what weapon specialization is before you can use it.   Weapon specialization becomes available to a fighter once he or she reaches 4th level, and gains another weapon proficiency slot.  Instead of spending the slot on learning an additional weapon, it is used to specialize the character in a weapon which he or she is already proficient.  Weapon specialization counts as two weapon proficiency slots.  Specializing in a bow other than a crossbow requires an additional proficiency slot, for a total of 3 slots, unless the character has a nonweapon proficiency in bowyer/fletcher, and has had the proficiency for at least 3 levels prior to bow specialization, and then bow specialization only costs two slots.  The benefits of weapon specialization are as follows.

Melee Weapons : 
     The character is +1 "to hit" and +2 to damage with the specialized weapon, above and beyond all other strength and magical bonuses.  The weapon must be a specific type, such as longsword or short sword, a opposed to a general sword.  In addition, a fighter gets additional attacks per round with the specialized weapon. 

Bows :
     Fighters using the long, short, and composite bows as a specialized weapon are entitled to a "point blank" range category.  Point blank range is from 6' to 30'.  The character is +2 "to hit" and +2 to damage against targets within this range, and furthermore, any successful hit inflicts double damage to the victim.  Additionally, a bow specialist who begins the round with arrow nocked, shaft drawn, and target in sight is entitled to loose that arrow prior to any initiative check.  The bow specialist is +1 "to hit" and damage at short range, and the penalties "to hit" for medium and long range are 0 and -2 respectively. 

Crossbows : 
     In the hands of a specialist, these weapons have a "point blank" range of 6' to 60'.  The crossbow specialist is +2 "to hit" and damage against targets in this range, and receives the same double damage benefit as a bow specialist. At short range, the crossbow specialist is +1 "to hit" and damage, and at medium range is +1 "to hit" only.  The modifier for long range for a crossbow specialist is 0.  Crossbow specialists also gain the "aimed shot" advantage of bow specialists as well.

Other Missile Weapons :
     Specialist users of other types of missile weapons gain a +1 "to hit" and a +2 bonus to damage with their specialized weapon.

Final Note :  All "to hit" bonuses granted by weapon specialization are not magical in nature, and will not affect creatures that are only hit by magical weapons.  If a fighter is wielding a magical weapon of the type in which he or she is specialized, all magical bonuses apply in addition to the bonuses gained for specialization.

Nonweapon Proficiencies 
     The most detailed method for handling character skills is that of nonweapon proficiencies. These are much like weapon proficiencies. Each character starts with a specific number of nonweapon proficiency slots and then earns additional slots as he advances. Initial slots must be assigned immediately; they cannot be saved or held in reserve.
		Unlike weapon proficiencies, in which some weapons are not available to certain character classes, all nonweapon proficiencies are available to all characters. Some nonweapon proficiencies are easier for certain character classes to learn, however. Note that the same groupings as are in the Players Handbook are used here, but the arrangement is a little different.  If a character wishes to obtain a proficiency in a group that is not one of the crossover groups of the class, the character must pay 1 additional slot for the proficiency.  All characters, regardless of class, gain nonweapon proficiencies at a rate of one additional proficiency for every three experience levels.

Using Nonweapon Proficiencies 
	When a character uses a proficiency, either the attempt is automatically successful, or the character must roll a proficiency check. If the task is simple or the proficiency has only limited game use (such as cobbling or carpentry), a proficiency check is generally not required. If the task the character is trying to perform is difficult or subject to failure, a proficiency check is required. Read the descriptions of the proficiencies for details about how and when each can be used.
	If a proficiency check is required, Table 37 lists which ability is used with each proficiency. Add the modifier (either positive or negative) listed in Table 37 to the appropriate ability score. Then the player rolls 1d20. If the roll is equal to or less than the character's adjusted ability score, the character accomplished what he was trying to do. If the roll is greater than the character's ability score, the character fails at the task. (A roll of 20 always fails.) The DM determines what effects, if any, accompany failure.
	Of course, to use a proficiency, the character must have any tools and materials needed to do the job.  A carpenter can do very little without his tools, and a smith is virtually helpless without a good forge. The character must also have enough time to do the job. Certainly, carpentry proficiency enables your character to build a house, but not in a single day! Some proficiency descriptions state how much time is required for certain jobs. Most, however, are left to the DM's judgment.
	The DM can raise or lower a character's chance of success if the situation calls for it. Factors that can affect a proficiency check include availability and quality of tools, quality of raw material used, time spent doing the job, difficulty of the job, and how familiar the character is with the task. A positive modifier is added to the ability score used for the check. A negative modifier is subtracted from the ability score.
	When two proficient characters work together on the same task, the highest ability score is used (the one with the greatest chance of success). Furthermore, a +1 bonus is added for the other character's assistance. The bonus can never be more than +1, as having too many assistants is sometimes worse than having none.
	Nonweapon proficiencies can also be improved beyond the ability score the character starts with. For every additional proficiency slot a character spends on a nonweapon proficiency, he gains a +1 bonus to those proficiency checks.  Many nonplayer craftsmen are more accomplished in their fields than player characters, having devoted all their energies to improving a single proficiency. Likewise, old masters normally have more talent than young apprentices--unless the youth has an exceptional ability score! However, age is no assurance of talent. Remember that knowing a skill and being good at it are two different things. There are bad potters, mediocre potters, and true craftsmen. All this has much less to do with age than with dedication and talent.

Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions 
	The following proficiency descriptions are arranged alphabetically, not according to character class. Each description gives a general outline of what a character with the proficiency knows and can do. Furthermore, some descriptions include rules to cover specific uses or situations, or exact instructions on the effects of the proficiency.
	Agriculture: The character has a knowledge of the basics of farming. This includes planting, harvesting, storing crops, tending animals, butchering, and other typical farming chores.
     Alchemy :  This proficiency constitutes the ability to use various alchemical practices, basic glassmaking, and familiarity with the equipment used in alchemical procedures.  A proficiency in alchemy does not allow the character to know the exact formulas to create things, only the methods and practices which are used in achieving the desired results.  It is of note that in most circumstances, a character who actually wishes to practice alchemy must have access to an alchemical laboratory in order to do so.
 	Ancient History: The character has learned the legends, lore, and history of some ancient time and place. The knowledge must be specific, just as a historian would specialize today in the English Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the Roman Republic before Caesar. (The DM either can have ancient periods in mind for his game or can allow the players to name and designate them.) Thus, a player character could know details about the Age of Thorac Dragonking or the Time of the Sea-Raiders or whatever else was available.
	The knowledge acquired gives the character familiarity with the principal legends, historical events, characters, locations, battles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and magical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and oddities of the time. The character must roll a proficiency check to identify places or things he encounters from that age. For example, Rath knows quite a bit about the Coming of the Trolls, a particularly dark period of dwarven history. Moving through some deep caverns, he and his companions stumble across an ancient portal, sealed for untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he realizes (rolls a successful proficiency check) that it bears several seals similar to those he has seen on "banned" portals from the time of Angnar, doorways to the legendary realm of Trolhel.
	Animal Handling: Proficiency in this area enables a character to exercise a greater-than-normal degree of control over pack animals and beasts of burden. A successful proficiency check indicates that the character has succeeded in calming an excited or agitated animal; in contrast, a character without this proficiency has only a 20% chance of succeeding in the attempt.
	Animal Lore: This proficiency enables a character to observe the actions or habitat of an animal and interpret what is going on. Actions can show how dangerous the creature is, whether it is hungry, protecting its young, or defending a nearby den. Furthermore, careful observation of signs and behaviors can even indicate the location of a water hole, animal herd, predator, or impending danger, such as a forest fire. The DM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A successful check means the character understood the basic actions of the creature. If the check fails by 4 or less, no information is gained. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character misinterprets the actions of the animal.
	A character may also imitate the calls and cries of animals that he is reasonably familiar with, based on his background. This ability is limited by volume. The roar of a tyrannosaurus rex would be beyond the abilities of a normal character. A successful proficiency check means that only magical means can distinguish the character's call from that of the true animal. The cry is sufficient to fool animals, perhaps frightening them away or luring them closer. A failed check means the sound is incorrect in some slight way. A failed call may still fool some listeners, but creatures very familiar with the cry automatically detect a false call. All other creatures and characters are allowed a Wisdom check to detect the fake.
	Finally, animal lore increases the chance of successfully setting snares and traps (for hunting) since the character knows the general habits of the creature hunted.
	Animal Training: Characters with this proficiency can train one type of creature (declared when the proficiency is chosen) to obey simple commands and perform tricks. A character can spend additional proficiencies to train other types of creatures or can improve his skill with an already chosen type. Creatures typically trained are dogs, horses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets, and parrots. A character can choose even more exotic creatures and monsters with animal intelligence (although these are difficult to control).
	A trainer can work with up to three creatures at one time. The trainer may choose to teach general tasks or specific tricks. A general task gives the creature the ability to react to a number of nonspecific commands to do its job. Examples of tasks include guard and attack, carry a rider, perform heavy labor, hunt, track, or fight alongside soldiers (such as a war horse or elephant). A specific trick teaches the trained creature to do one specific action. A horse may rear on command, a falcon may pluck a designated object, a dog may attack a specific person, or a rat may run through a particular maze. With enough time, a creature can be trained to do both general tasks and specific tricks.
	Training for a general task requires three months of uninterrupted work. Training for a specific trick requires 2d6 weeks. At the end of the training time, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the animal is trained. If the die roll fails, the beast is untrainable. An animal can be trained in 2d4 general tasks or specific tricks, or any combination of the two.
	An animal trainer can also try to tame wild animals (preparing them for training later on). Wild animals can be tamed only when they are very young. The taming requires one month of uninterrupted work with the creature. At the end of the month, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the beast is suitable for training. If the check fails, the creature retains enough of its wild behavior to make it untrainable. It can be kept, though it must be leashed or caged.
	Appraising: This proficiency is highly useful for thieves, as it allows characters to estimate the value and authenticity of antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gemstones, or other crafted items they find (although the DM can exclude those items too exotic or rare to be well known). The character must have the item in hand to examine. A successful proficiency check (rolled by the DM) enables the character to estimate the value of the item to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gp and to identify fakes. On a failed check, the character cannot estimate a price at all. On a roll of 20, the character wildly misreads the value of the item, always to the detriment of the character.
	Armorer: This character can make all of the types of armor listed in the Player's Handbook, given the proper materials and facilities. When making armor, the proficiency check is rolled at the end of the normal construction time.
	The time required to make armor is equal to two weeks per level of AC below 10. For example, a shield would require two weeks of work, whereas a suit of full plate armor would require 18 weeks of work.  If the proficiency check indicates failure but is within 4 of the amount needed for success, the armorer has created usable, but flawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1 AC worse than usual, although it looks like the armor it was intended to be. Only a character with armorer proficiency can detect the flaws, and this requires careful and detailed inspection.  If the flawed armor is struck in melee combat with a natural die roll of 19 or 20, it breaks. The character's AC immediately worsens by 4 additional classes (although never above 10), and the broken armor hampers the character's movement. Until the character can remove the broken armor (a process requiring 1d4 rounds), the character moves at 1/2 of his normal rate and suffers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls.  If an armorer is creating a suit of field plate or full plate armor, the character who will use the armor must be present at least once a week during the creation of the armor, since such types of armor require very exact fitting.


	Artistic Ability: Player characters with artistic ability are naturally accomplished in various forms of the arts. They have an inherent understanding of color, form, space, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Characters with artistic ability must select one art form (painting, sculpture, composition, etc.) to be proficient in. Thereafter they can attempt to create art works or musical compositions in their given field. Although it is not necessary to make a proficiency check, one can be made to determine the quality of the work. If a 1 is rolled on the check, the artist has created a work with some truly lasting value. If the check fails, the artist has created something aesthetically unpleasing or just plain bad.  Artistic ability also confers a +1 bonus to all proficiency checks requiring artistic skill--music or dance--and to attempts to appraise objects of art.
     Assassination :  This proficiency allows a character to attack a surprised opponent as per the rules for assassins and assassination presented in the 1st edition Dungeon Masters Guide.
	Astrology: This proficiency gives the character some understanding of the supposed influences of the stars. Knowing the birth date and time of any person, the astrologer can study the stars and celestial events and then prepare a forecast of the future for that person. The astrologer's insight into the future is limited to the next 30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best. If a successful proficiency check is made, the astrologer can foresee some general event--a great battle, a friend lost, a new friendship made, etc. The DM decides the exact prediction (based on his intentions for the next few gaming sessions). Note that the prediction does not guarantee the result--it only indicates the potential result. If the proficiency check is failed, no information is gained unless a 20 is rolled, in which case the prediction is wildly inaccurate.
	Clearly this proficiency requires preparation and advance knowledge on the part of the DM. Because of this, it is permissible for the DM to avoid the question, although this shouldn't be done all the time. Players who want to make their DM's life easier (always a good idea) should consider using this proficiency at the end of a gaming session, giving the DM until the next session to come up with an answer. The DM can use this proficiency as a catalyst and guide for his adventures--something that will prompt the player characters to go to certain places or to try new things.  Characters with the astrology proficiency gain a +1 bonus to all navigation proficiency checks, provided the stars can be seen.
	Blind-fighting: A character with blind-fighting is skilled at fighting in conditions of poor or no light (but this proficiency does not allow spell use). In total darkness, the character suffers only a -2 penalty to his attack roll (as compared to a -4 penalty without this proficiency). Under starlight or moonlight, the character incurs only a -1 penalty. The character suffers no penalties to his AC because of darkness.
	Furthermore, the character retains special abilities that would normally be lost in darkness, although the effectiveness of these are reduced by one-half (proficiency checks are made at half the normal score, etc.). This proficiency is effective only against opponents or threats within melee distance of the character. Blind-fighting does not grant any special protection from missile fire or anything outside the immediate range of the character's melee weapon. Thus, AC penalties remain for missile fire. (By the time the character hears the whoosh of the arrow, for example, it is too late for him to react.)  While moving in darkness, the character suffers only half the normal movement penalty of those without this proficiency.  Furthermore, this skill aids the character when dealing with invisible creatures, reducing the attack penalty to -2. However, it does not enable the character to discover invisible creatures; he has only a general idea of their location and cannot target them exactly.
     Boating : If a  character with this proficiency is piloting a boat, canoe, or other waterborne vessel, it can be moved at its fastest possible rate.  Also the presence of such a character  reduces the chance of the craft capsizing in  rough water or when it is on a body of water during high winds. This proficiency covers only small craft; the seamanship proficiency is required to handle ships.
	Bowyer/Fletcher: This character can make bows and arrows in one of two categories: simple bows and crossbows.  If a character wishes to be proficient in making both, then two proficiencies are required.
	A weaponsmith is required to fashion arrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can perform all other necessary functions.  When the construction time for the weapon is completed, the player makes a proficiency check. If the check is successful, the weapon is of fine quality and will last for many years of normal use without breaking. If the check fails, the weapon is still usable, but has a limited life span: An arrow breaks on the first shot; a bow breaks if the character using it rolls an unmodified 1 on his 1d20 attack roll.
	Option: If a character wishes to create a weapon of truly fine quality and the DM allows it, the player can opt to use the following alternative procedure for determining the success of his attempt. When the proficiency check is made, any failure means that the weapon is useless. However, a successful check means that the weapon enables the character to add Strength bonuses to attack and damage rolls. Additionally, if the proficiency check is a natural 1, the range of the bow is increased 10 yards for all range classes or is of such fine work that it is suitable for enchantment.
	Brewing: The character is trained in the art of brewing beers and other strong drink. The character can prepare brewing formulas, select quality ingredients, set up and manage a brewery, control fermentation, and age the finished product.
	Carpentry: The carpentry proficiency enables the character to do woodworking jobs: building houses, cabinetry, joinery, etc. Tools and materials must be available. The character can build basic items from experience, without the need for plans. Unusual and more complicated items (a catapult, for example) require plans prepared by an engineer. Truly unusual or highly complex items (wooden clockwork mechanisms, for example) require a proficiency check.
	Charioteering: A character with proficiency in this skill is able to safely guide a chariot, over any type of terrain that can normally be negotiated, at a rate 1/3 faster than the normal movement rate for a chariot driven by a character without this proficiency. Note that this proficiency does not impart the ability to move a chariot over terrain that it cannot traverse; even the best charioteer in the world cannot take such a vehicle into the mountains.
	Cobbling: The character can fashion and repair shoes, boots, and sandals.
	Cooking: Although all characters have rudimentary cooking skills, the character with this proficiency is an accomplished cook. A proficiency check is required only when attempting to prepare a truly magnificent meal worthy of a master chef.
	Dancing: The character knows many styles and varieties of dance, from folk dances to formal court balls.
	Direction Sense: A character with this proficiency has an innate sense of direction. By concentrating for 1d6 rounds, the character can try to determine the direction the party is headed. If the check fails but is less than 20, the character errs by 90 degrees. If a 20 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly opposite the true heading. (The DM rolls the check.)
	Furthermore, when traveling in the wilderness, a character with direction sense has the chance of becoming lost reduced by 5%.
	Disguise: The character with this skill is trained in the art of disguise. He can make himself look like any general type of person of about the same height, age, weight, and race. A successful proficiency check indicates that the disguise is successful, while a failed roll means the attempt was too obvious in some way.
	The character can also disguise himself as a member of another race or sex. In this case, a -7 penalty is applied to the proficiency check. The character may also attempt to disguise himself as a specific person, with a -10 penalty to the proficiency check. These modifiers are cumulative, thus, it is extremely difficult for a character to disguise himself as a specific person of another race or sex (a -17 penalty to the check).
	Endurance: A character with endurance proficiency is able to perform continual strenuous physical activity for twice as long as a normal character before becoming subject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. In those cases where extreme endurance is required, a successful proficiency check must be made. Note that this proficiency does not enable a character to extend the length of time that he can remain unaffected by a lack of food or water.
	Engineering: The character is trained as a builder of both great and small things. Engineers can prepare plans for everything from simple machines (catapults, river locks, grist mills) to large buildings (fortresses, dams). A proficiency check is required only when designing something particularly complicated or unusual. An engineer must still find talented workmen to carry out his plan, but he is trained to supervise and manage their work.  An engineer is also familiar with the principles of siegecraft and can detect flaws in the defenses of a castle or similar construction. He knows how to construct and use siege weapons and machines, such as catapults, rams, and screws.
	Etiquette: This proficiency gives the character a basic understanding of the proper forms of behavior and address required in many different situations, especially those involving nobility and persons of rank. Thus, the character will know the correct title to use when addressing a duke, the proper steps of ceremony to greet visiting diplomats, gestures to avoid in the presence of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual occurrences, a proficiency check must be made for the character to know the proper etiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, for example, is a sufficiently rare event).  However, having the character know what is correct and actually do what is correct are two different matters. The encounters must still be role-played by the character. Knowledge of etiquette does not give the character protection from a gaffe or faux pas; many people who know the correct thing still manage to do the exact opposite.
	Fire-building: A character with fire-building proficiency does not normally need a tinderbox to start a fire. Given some dry wood and small pieces of tinder, he can start a fire in 2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not required. Wet wood, high winds, or other adverse conditions increase the time to 3d20, and a successful proficiency check must be rolled to start a fire.
	Fishing: The character is skilled in the art of fishing, be it with hook and line, net, or spear. Each hour the character spends fishing, roll a proficiency check. If the roll is failed, no fish are caught that hour. Otherwise, a hook and line or a spear will land fish equal to the difference between the die roll and the character's Wisdom score. A net will catch three times this amount.  Of course, no fish can be caught where no fish are found. On the other hand, some areas teem with fish, such as a river or pool during spawning season. The DM may modify the results according to the situation.
     Foraging : Similar to the fishing proficiency, this skill enables a character to locate and obtain edible plants more easily than a character without the skill can.  A successful proficiency check indicates that the character is able to find twice the amount of edible plants that a nonproficient character would in a given amount of time.
	Forgery: This proficiency enables the character to create duplicates of documents and handwriting and to detect such forgeries created by others. To forge a document (military orders, local decrees, etc.) where the handwriting is not specific to a person, the character needs only to have seen a similar document before. To forge a name, an autograph of that person is needed, and a proficiency check with a -2 penalty must be successfully rolled. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of his handwriting is needed, with a -3 penalty to the check.
	It is important to note that the forger always thinks he has been successful; the DM rolls the character's proficiency check in secret and the forger does not learn of a failure until it is too late.
	If the check succeeds, the work will pass examination by all except those intimately familiar with that handwriting or by those with the forgery proficiency who examine the document carefully. If the check is failed, the forgery is detectable to anyone familiar with the type of document or handwriting--if he examines the document closely. If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is immediately detectable to anyone who normally handles such documents without close examination. The forger will not realize this until too late.
	Furthermore, those with forgery proficiency may examine a document to learn if it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency roll, the authenticity of any document can be ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a 20 is not rolled, the answer is unknown. If a 20 is rolled, the character reaches the incorrect conclusion.
     Fungus Identification : This proficiency is useful on extended  expeditions where characters intend to live off the land, especially in underground settings.  Fungi are the only plant-like living things that commonly grow underground, and approximately 50% of all fungi discovered there, or anywhere else, are deadly poisonous.  For this reason, an edible fungus harvest is virtually impossible without the aid of a character proficient in fungus identification.  If the character has plentiful light and an opportunity to study the fungus in question for at least one turn, no proficiency check is necessary, however, if a character is unable to see the fungus clearly, or must make a hasty decision about whether or not it is edible, the check must be made.
	Gaming: The character knows most common games of chance and skill, including cards, dice, bones, draughts, and chess. When playing a game, the character may either play out the actual game (which may take too much time for some) or make a proficiency check, with success indicating victory. If two proficient characters play each other, the one with the highest successful die roll wins. A character with gaming proficiency can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a +1 bonus to his ability score. If the proficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, however, the character has been caught cheating (even if he won the game).
	Gem Cutting: A character with this proficiency can finish the rough gems that are discovered through mining at a rate of 1d10 stones per day. A gem cutter derives no benefit from the assistance of nonproficient characters. A gem cutter must work with a good light source and must have an assortment of chisels, small hammers, and specially hardened blades.
	Uncut gems, while still of value, are not nearly as valuable as the finished product. If the cutting is successful (as determined by a proficiency check), the gem cutter increases the value of a given stone to the range appropriate for its type. If a 1 is rolled, the work is exceptionally brilliant and the value of the gem falls into the range for the next most valuable gem (the DM has the relevant tables).
     Geology :  A proficiency in geology gives a character a basic knowledge of rocks and minerals, geological forms and structures, and a basic understanding of the formation of these and other geological phenomenon.  It allows the character to be able to identify common rocks, rock-forming minerals, crystals, common gemstones, rock formations, and other such things.  It will also allow a proficient character to be able to determine whether or not formations and structures in the earth are natural or man made, and can tell, to a limited extent, how relatively old these structures are.  A geologist can also use his or her knowledge to be able to find underground water, minerals, ores, and the like.
	Healing:  A character proficient in healing knows how to use natural medicines and basic principles of first aid and doctoring. If the character tends another within one round of wounding (and makes a successful proficiency check), his ministrations restore 1d3 hit points (but no more hit points can be restored than were lost in the previous round). Only one healing attempt can be made on a character per day.  If a wounded character remains under the care of someone with healing proficiency, that character can recover lost hit points at the rate of 1 per day even when traveling or engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the wounded character gets complete rest, he can recover 2 hit points per day while under such care. Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can help others recover at the rate of 3 hit points per day of rest. This care does not require a proficiency check, only the regular attention of the proficient character. Up to six patients can be cared for at any time.  A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to aid a poisoned individual, provided the poison entered through a wound. If the poisoned character can be tended to immediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and the care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a +2 bonus to his saving throw (delay his saving throw until the last round of tending). No proficiency check is required, but the poisoned character must be tended to immediately (normally by sacrificing any other action by the proficient character) and cannot do anything himself. If the care and rest are interrupted, the poisoned character must immediately roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result is unalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't help). Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can attempt the same treatment for poisons the victim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his healing to diagnose the poison and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a purgative).  A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to diagnose and treat diseases. When dealing with normal diseases, a successful proficiency check automatically reduces the disease to its mildest form and shortest duration. Those who also have herbalism knowledge gain an additional +2 bonus to this check. A proficient character can also attempt to deal with magical diseases, whether caused by spells or creatures. In this case, a successful proficiency check diagnoses the cause of the disease. However, since the disease is magical in nature, it can be treated only by magical means.
	Heraldry: The knowledge of heraldry enables the character to identify the different crests and symbols that denote different persons and groups. Heraldry comes in many forms and is used for many different purposes. It can be used to identify noblemen, families, guilds, sects, legions, political factions, and castes. The symbols may appear on flags, shields, helmets, badges, embroidery, standards, clothing, coins, and more. The symbols used may include geometric patterns, calligraphed lines of script, fantastic beasts, religious symbols, and magical seals (made for the express purpose of identification). Heraldry can vary from the highly formalized rules and regulations of late medieval Europe to the knowledge of different shield patterns and shapes used by African tribesmen.  The character automatically knows the different heraldic symbols of his homeland and whom they are associated with. In addition, if the character makes a successful proficiency check, he can correctly identify the signs and symbols of other lands, provided he has at least a passing knowledge of the inhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is of little use upon first entering a foreign land.
	Herbalism: Those with herbalist knowledge can identify plants and fungus and prepare nonmagical potions, poultices, powders, balms, salves, ointments, infusions, and plasters for medical and pseudo-medical purposes. They can also prepare natural plant poisons and purgatives. The DM must decide the exact strength of such poisons based on the poison rules in the DMG. A character with both herbalism and healing proficiencies gains bonuses when using his healing talent (see the Healing proficiency).
	Hunting: When in wilderness settings, the character can attempt to stalk and bring down game. A proficiency check must be made with a -1 penalty to the ability score for every nonproficient hunter in the party. If the die roll is successful, the hunter (and those with him) have come within 101 to 200 yards (100+1d100) of an animal. The group can attempt to close the range, but a proficiency check must be made for each 20 yards closed. If the stalking is successful, the hunter automatically surprises the game. The type of animal stalked depends on the nature of the terrain and the whim of the DM.
	Juggling: The character can juggle, a talent useful for entertainments, diversions, and certain rare emergencies. When juggling normally (to entertain or distract), no proficiency check is required. A check is made when trying spectacular tricks ("Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!"). However, juggling also enables the character to attempt desperate moves. On a successful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a proficiency check), the character can catch small items thrown to harm him (as opposed to items thrown for him to catch). Thus, the character could catch a dagger or a dart before it hits. If this attack roll fails, however, the character automatically suffers damage (sticking your hand in the path of a dagger is likely to hurt).
	Jumping: The character can attempt exceptional leaps both vertically and horizontally. If the character has at least a 20-foot running start, he can leap (broad jump) 2d6+his level in feet. No character can broad jump more than six times his height, however. With the same start, he can leap vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus half his level in feet. No character can high jump more than 1-1/2 times his own height.  From a standing start, a character with this proficiency can broad jump 1d6 plus half his level in feet and high jump only three feet.
	The character can also attempt vaults using a pole. A vault requires at least a 30-foot running start. If a pole is used, it must be four to 10 feet longer than the character's height. The vault spans a distance equal to 1-1/2 times the length of the pole. The character can clear heights equal to the height of the pole. He can also choose to land on his feet if the vault carries him over an obstacle no higher than 1/2 the height of his pole. Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the character could either vault through a window 12 feet off the ground (tumbling into the room beyond), land on his feet in an opening six feet off the ground, or vault across a moat 18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped at the end of the vault.
	Leatherworking: This proficiency enables a character to tan and treat leather and to make clothing and other leather objects. The character can make leather armor, as well as backpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and all sorts of harnesses.
	Local History: The character is a storehouse of facts about the history of a region the size of a large county or a small province. The character knows when the ruined tower on the hill was built and who built it (and what happened to him), what great heroes and villains fought and fell at the old battlefield, what great treasure is supposed to be kept in a local temple, how the mayor of the next town miraculously grew hair on his balding pate, and more.
	The DM will provide information about local sites and events as the character needs to know them. Furthermore, the character can try to retell these events as entertaining stories. Once the subject is chosen, he can either make a proficiency check and, if successful, add that tale to his repertoire, or actually tell the story to other characters. If the character succeeds in entertaining them, the player need not make a proficiency roll for the character, since he has succeeded. The character can tell these stories to entertain others, granting him a +2 bonus to his Charisma for the encounter. But telling stories to hostile beings is probably not going to do any good.
     Metallurgy :  A proficiency in metallurgy confers to a character the knowledge of the properties of metals and the methods, procedures, uses, and formulas for the alloying of common metals, their most common and practical uses, and the ability to create new alloys by applying the knowledge of these metals.  Further proficiency slots taken in metallurgy allow a character to learn about the less common metals available, and their properties and uses. 
	Metalsmithing: A character with metalsmithing proficiency is capable of making tools and implements from the metal for which they are a smith (ex.: a blacksmith would work in  iron) . Use of the proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed fire and bellows, as well as a hammer and anvil. The character cannot make armor or most weapons, but can craft crowbars, grappling hooks, horseshoes, nails, hinges, plows, and most other metal objects.


	Mining: A character with mining proficiency is needed to site and supervise the operations of any mine. First, the character can attempt to determine what types of ores or gems can be found in a given area. To do this, he must spend at least a week searching a four-square-mile area. The DM may rule that more area must be searched to find anything of value and may thus increase the amount of time required. At the end of the search, the character can say what is likely to be found in this area. After this, the character can site the mine. On a successful proficiency check (made secretly by the DM), the character has found a good site to begin mining for any minerals that may be in the area. The check does not guarantee a successful mine, only that a particular site is the best choice in a given area. The DM must determine what minerals, if any, are to be found in the region of the mine. On a failed check, the character only thinks he has found a good site. Much effort is spent before the character is proved wrong, of course.  Once the mine is in operation, a character with mining proficiency must remain on site to supervise all work. Although this is a steady job, most player characters will find it better to hire an NPC for this purpose.
	Mountaineering: A character with this proficiency can make difficult and dangerous climbs up steep slopes and cliffs with the aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with mountaineering proficiency leads a party, placing the pitons (spikes) and guiding the others, all in the party can gain the benefit of his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide a party up a cliff face it could not otherwise climb. A character with this proficiency gains a 10% bonus per proficiency slot spent to his chance to climb any surface. Note that mountaineering is not the same as the thief's climbing ability, since the latter does not require aids of any sort.
	Musical Instrument: The character can play a specific musical instrument. An additional instrument can be added for every extra slot devoted to this proficiency. The character plays quite well, and no proficiency check is normally required. The DM may direct the character to make a proficiency check in what he feels are extraordinary circumstances.
	Navigation: The character has learned the arts of navigating by the stars, studying currents, and watching for telltale signs of land, reefs, and hidden danger. This is not particularly useful on land. At sea, a successful proficiency check by the navigator reduces the chance of getting lost by 20 percent.
	Psychology: A character proficient in psychology is familiar with the common emotional and behavioral characteristics of an individual, a group, or an activity, as they relate to a specific race or closely related races.  Such a character is familiar with the various psychological disorders and insanities, and can properly diagnose a character who has such a disorder.  If treatment is possible, the proficient character can also attempt to treat an afflicted individual, with variable degrees of success possible.  The proficient character is also able to perform more mundane tasks such as counseling, advice, minor psychotherapy, dealing with grief, and the like.
	Pottery: A character with this proficiency can create any type of clay vessel or container commonly used in the campaign world. The character requires a wheel and a kiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze. The character can generally create two small- or medium-sized items or one large-sized item per day. The pieces of pottery must then be fired in the kiln for an additional day.
	The raw materials involved cost 3 cp to make a small item, 5 cp to make a medium-sized item, and 1 sp to make a large item.
	Reading Lips: The character can understand the speech of those he can see but not hear. When this proficiency is chosen, the player must specify what language the character can lip read (it must be a language the character can already speak). To use the proficiency, the character must be within 30 feet of the speaker and be able to see him speak. A proficiency check is made. If the check fails, nothing is learned. If the check is successful, 70% of the conversation is understood. Since certain sounds are impossible to differentiate, the understanding of a lip-read conversation is never better than this.
	Religion: Characters with religion proficiency know the common beliefs and cults of their homeland and the major faiths of neighboring regions. Ordinary information (type of religious symbol used, basic attitude of the faith, etc.) of any religion is automatically known by the character. Special information, such as how the clergy is organized or the significance of particular holy days, requires a proficiency check.
	Additional proficiencies spent on religion enable the character either to expand his general knowledge into more distant regions (using the guidelines above) or to gain precise information about a single faith. If the latter is chosen, the character is no longer required to make a proficiency check when answering questions about that religion. Such expert knowledge is highly useful to cleric characters when dealing with their own and rival faiths.
	Riding, Airborne: The character is trained in handling a flying mount. The particular creature must be chosen when the proficiency is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can be used to learn how to handle other types of mounts. Unlike land-based riding, a character must have this proficiency (or ride with someone who does) to handle a flying mount. In addition, a proficient character can do the following:
	 Leap onto the saddle of the creature (when it is standing on the ground) and spur it airborne as a single action. This requires no proficiency check.
 	 Leap from the back of the mount and drop 10 feet to the ground or onto the back of another mount (land-based or flying). Those with only light encumbrance can drop to the ground without a proficiency check. In all other situations, a proficiency check is required. A failed roll means the character takes normal falling damage (for falling flat on his face) or misses his target (perhaps taking large amounts of damage as a result). A character who is dropping to the ground can attempt an immediate melee attack, if his proficiency check is made with a -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure has the consequences given above.
 	 Spur his mount to greater speeds on a successful check, adding 1d4 to the movement rate of the mount. This speed can be maintained for four consecutive rounds. If the check fails, an attempt can be made again the next round. If two checks fail, no attempt can be made for a full turn. After the rounds of increased speed, its movement drops to 2/3 its normal rate and its Maneuverability Class (see Glossary) becomes one class worse. These conditions last until the mount lands and is allowed to rest for at least one hour.
   The rider can guide the mount with his knees and feet, keeping his hands free. A proficiency check is made only after the character suffers damage. If the check is failed, the character is knocked from the saddle. A second check is allowed to see if the character manages to catch himself (thus hanging from the side by one hand or in some equally perilous position). If this fails, the rider falls. Of course a rider can strap himself into the saddle, although this could be a disadvantage if his mount is slain and plummets toward the ground.
	Riding, Land-Based: Those skilled in land riding are proficient in the art of riding and handling horses or other types of ground mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled, the character must declare which type of mount he is proficient in. Possibilities include griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and virtually any creatures used as mounts by humans, demihumans, or humanoids.  A character with riding proficiency can perform all of the following feats. Some of them are automatic, while others require a proficiency check for success.
 	 The character can vault onto a saddle whenever the horse or other mount is standing still, even when the character is wearing armor. This does not require a proficiency check. The character must make a check, however, if he wishes to get the mount moving during the same round in which he lands in its saddle. He must also make a proficiency check if he attempts to vault onto the saddle of a moving mount. Failure indicates that the character falls to the ground--presumably quite embarrassed.
 	 The character can urge the mount to jump tall obstacles or leap across gaps. No check is required if the obstacle is less than three feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet wide. If the character wants to roll a proficiency check, the mount can be urged to leap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump across gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success means that the mount has made the jump. Failure indicates that it balks, and the character must make another proficiency check to see whether he retains his seat or falls to the ground.
 	 The character can spur his steed on to great speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the animal's movement rate for up to four turns. This requires a proficiency check each turn to see if the mount can be pushed this hard. If the initial check fails, no further attempts may be made, but the mount can move normally. If the second or subsequent check fails, the mount immediately slows to a walk, and the character must dismount and lead the animal for a turn. In any event, after four turns of racing, the steed must be walked by its dismounted rider for one turn.
 	 The character can guide his mount with his knees, enabling him to use weapons that require two hands (such as bows and two-handed swords) while mounted. This feat does not require a proficiency check unless the character takes damage while so riding. In this case, a check is required and failure means that the character falls to the ground and sustains an additional 1d6 points of damage.
 	 The character can drop down and hang alongside the steed, using it as a shield against attack. The character cannot make an attack or wear armor while performing this feat. The character's Armor Class is lowered by 6 while this maneuver is performed. Any attacks that would have struck the character's normal Armor Class are considered to have struck the mount instead. No proficiency check is required.
 	 The character can leap from the back of his steed to the ground and make a melee attack against any character or creature within 10 feet. The player must roll a successful proficiency check with a -4 penalty to succeed. On a failed roll, the character fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to the ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage.
	Rope Use: This proficiency enables a character to accomplish amazing feats with rope. A character with rope use proficiency is familiar with all sorts of knots and can tie knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or loosen with a quick tug. If the character's hands are bound and held with a knot, he can roll a proficiency check (with a -6 penalty) to escape the bonds.  This character gains a +2 bonus to all attacks made with a lasso. The character also receives a +10% bonus to all climbing checks made while he is using a rope, including attempts to belay (secure the end of a climbing rope) companions.
	Running: The character can move at twice his normal movement rate for a day. At the end of the day he must sleep for eight hours. After the first day's movement, the character must roll a proficiency check for success. If the die roll succeeds, the character can continue his running movement the next day. If the die roll fails, the character cannot use his running ability the next day. If involved in a battle during a day he spent running, he suffers a -1 penalty to his attack rolls.
	Seamanship: The character is familiar with boats and ships. He is qualified to work as a crewman, although he cannot actually navigate. Crews of trained seamen are necessary to manage any ship, and they improve the movement rates of inland boats by 50 percent.
	Seamstress/Tailor: The character can sew and design clothing. He can also do all kinds of embroidery and ornamental work. Although no proficiency check is required, the character must have at least needle and thread to work.
	Set Snares: The character can make simple snares and traps, primarily to catch small game. These can include rope snares and spring traps. A proficiency check must be rolled when the snare is first constructed and every time the snare is set. A failed proficiency check means the trap does not work for some reason. It may be that the workmanship was bad, the character left too much scent in the area, or he poorly concealed the finished work. The exact nature of the problem does not need to be known. The character can also attempt to set traps and snares for larger creatures: tiger pits and net snares, for example. A proficiency check must be rolled, this time with a -4 penalty to the ability score. In both cases, setting a successful snare does not ensure that it catches anything, only that the snare works if triggered. The DM must decide if the trap is triggered.
	Thief characters (and only thieves) with this proficiency can also attempt to rig man-traps. These can involve such things as crossbows, deadfalls, spiked springboards, etc. The procedure is the same as that for setting a large snare. The DM must determine the amount of damage caused by a man-trap.
	Setting a small snare or trap takes one hour of work. Setting a larger trap requires two to three people (only one need have the proficiency) and 2d4 hours of work. Setting a man-trap requires one or more people (depending on its nature) and 1d8 hours of work. To prepare any trap, the character must have appropriate materials on hand.
	Characters with animal lore proficiency gain a +2 bonus to their ability score when attempting to set a snare for the purposes of catching game. Their knowledge of animals and the woods serves them well for this purpose. They gain no benefit when attempting to trap monsters or intelligent beings.
     Signaling :  The signaling proficiency includes all forms of communication between individuals who are beyond the range of discernable audibility but still within sight of each other.  Essentially, it constitutes methods of nonmagical long distance communication.  Signaling includes communicating via flares, mirrors, nonspecific sounds, flags ( semaphore ), smoke, and the like.  Signaling is only possible when the parties who are communicating can see each other's signals.
	Singing: The character is an accomplished singer and can use this ability to entertain others and perhaps earn a small living (note that bards can do this automatically). No proficiency check is required to sing. The character can also create choral works on a successful proficiency check.
     Slow Respiration : A character with this proficiency has the ability to enter a deep trance and greatly reduce the amount of air he or she needs to stay alive.  In order to induce the trance, the character must be in a restful position; either sitting or lying down.  After concentrating for one turn, the character's pulse and breathing drop well below normal, so that he or she uses air only 10% as fast as when resting.  The character can emerge from the trance at will and is fully aware of anything happening nearby while the trance is in effect.


     Sound Analysis : This proficiency allows a character to gauge the size of underground areas and outdoor distances by creating noise and judging the echoes that return.  Using this skill, the character can calculate distances of up to one mile.  The proficiency can also be used to determine the direction of a sound.  To use sound analysis, the character must work in conditions of absolute silence.  The sound created must have a sharp, somewhat staccato quality.  A howl or wail is ineffective, but a clicking sound or loud "hey" works well.  When this proficiency is used, a proficiency check is required.  If the check is successful, the character has correctly analyzed the size of the area in question, within +/- 25% in each direction.  If the check fails, the echo has become garbled in the course of its reverberations.  No further attempts to analyze the same area by that character will be successful.  Other proficient characters may still try their luck, however.  An obvious disadvantage of this ability is that while it is most useful for learning about a new area, using it announces the presence of the character.  Creatures hearing sound analysis used will certainly be prepared for some kind of intrusion, and may very well go looking for the perpetrators.  This proficiency can be used in conjunction with the animal lore proficiency.
 	Spellcraft: Although this proficiency does not grant the character any spellcasting powers, it does give him familiarity with the different forms and rites of spellcasting. If he observes and overhears someone who is casting a spell, or if he examines the material components used, he can attempt to identify the spell being cast. A proficiency check must be rolled to make a correct identification. Magic user specialists gain a +3 bonus to the check when attempting to identify magic of their own school. Note that since the spellcaster must be observed until the very instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency does not grant an advantage against combat spells. The proficiency is quite useful, however, for identifying spells that would otherwise have no visible effect.  Those talented in this proficiency also have a chance (equal to 1/2 of their normal proficiency check) of recognizing magical or magically endowed constructs for what they are.
	Stonemasonry: A stonemason is able to build structures from stone so that they last many years. He can do simple stone carvings, such as lettering, columns, and flourishes. The stone can be mortared, carefully fitted without mortar, or loosely fitted and chinked with rocks and earth. A stonemason equipped with his tools (hammers, chisels, wedges, block and tackle) can build a plain section of wall one foot thick, ten feet long, and five feet high in one day, provided the stone has already been cut. A stonemason can also supervise the work of unskilled laborers to quarry stone; one stonemason is needed for every five laborers. Dwarves are among the most accomplished stonemasons in the world; they receive a +2 bonus when using this skill.
	Survival: This proficiency must be applied to a specific environment--i.e., a specific type of terrain and weather factors. Typical environments include arctic, woodland, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. The character has basic survival knowledge for that terrain type. Additional proficiency slots can be used to add more types of terrain.  A character skilled in survival has a basic knowledge of the hazards he might face in that land. He understands the effects of the weather and knows the proper steps to lessen the risk of exposure. He knows the methods to locate or gather drinkable water. He knows how to find basic, not necessarily appetizing, food where none is apparent, thus staving off starvation. Furthermore, a character with survival skill can instruct and aid others in the same situation. When using the proficiency to find food or water, the character must roll a proficiency check. If the check is failed, no more attempts can be made that day.  The survival skill in no way releases the player characters from the hardships and horrors of being lost in the wilderness. At best it alleviates a small portion of the suffering. The food found is barely adequate, and water is discovered in minuscule amounts. It is still quite possible for a character with survival knowledge to die in  the wilderness. Indeed, the little knowledge the character has may lead to overconfidence and doom!
	Swimming: A character with swimming proficiency knows how to swim and can move according to the rules given in the Swimming section. Those without this proficiency cannot swim. They can hold their breath and float, but they cannot move themselves about in the water.
     Teamster :  A proficient character with the teamster proficiency has the knowledge of how to correctly load any land-based transport vehicle to its maximum capacity and/or efficiency, the proper care of such vehicles, and the ability to handle and control draft animals.  A teamster character can also determine the condition of the transport vehicle, evaluate traveling conditions for such a vehicle, and determine how many draft animals are necessary to pull the specified load.  The proficiency in teamster must be specific as to which transport vehicle ( such as cart or wagon ), but it is not necessary to specify what type of draft animals.  A proficient teamster is able to guide his or her chosen transport from a position within the vehicle rather than leading the animals from the front, and can travel extraordinary terrain conditions ( i.e. anywhere that is not a road ).  The teamster proficiency does not include animal handling, animal training, or the like; simply the aspect of driving the transport vehicle.
	Tightrope Walking: The character can attempt to walk narrow ropes or beams with greater than normal chances of success. He can negotiate any narrow surface not angled up or down greater than 45 degrees. Each round the character can walk 60 feet. One proficiency check is made every 60 feet (or part thereof), with failure indicating a fall. The check is made with a -10 penalty to the ability score if the surface is one inch or less in width (a rope), a -5 penalty if two inches to six inches wide, and unmodified if seven inches to 12 inches wide. Wider than one foot requires no check for proficient characters under normal circumstances. Every additional proficiency spent on tightrope walking reduces these penalties by 1. Use of a balancing rod reduces the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in the line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.
	The character can attempt to fight while on a tightrope, but he suffers a -5 penalty to his attack roll and must roll a successful proficiency check at the beginning of each round to avoid falling off. Since the character cannot maneuver, he gains no adjustments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he is struck while on the rope, he must roll an immediate proficiency check to retain his balance.
     Toxicology :  A skill in toxicology bestows a basic knowledge of poisons, antidotes, and the methods used in manufacturing these substances.  This will include such things as organic poisons, naturally occurring noxious and lethal substances, mineral poisons, some common alchemical poisons, and creature venoms.  A proficient character can manufacture poisons and their antidotes ( if there is one ) if the character has encountered and examined the substance previously.  This proficiency in combination with healing and/or herbalism is exceptionally beneficial.  If a character has the healing proficiency, also being proficient in toxicology gives a bonus of  +3 to any healing proficiency check and doubles the effectiveness of attentions by such a character over a wounded person.  This effect is cumulative with the herbalism proficiency.
	Tracking: Characters with tracking proficiency are able to follow the trail of creatures and characters across most types of terrain. Characters who are not rangers roll a proficiency check with a -6 penalty to their ability scores; rangers have no penalty to their ability scores. In addition, other modifiers are also applied to the attempt, according to the table below.

Tracking Modifiers

Terrain				Modifier
Soft or muddy ground	+4
Thick brush, vines, or reeds	+3
Occasional signs of passage, dust	+2
Normal ground, wood floor	0
Rocky ground or shallow water	-10
Every two creatures in the group	+1
Every 12 hours since trail was made	-1
Every hour of rain, snow, or sleet	-5
Poor lighting (moon or starlight)	-6
Tracked party attempts to hide trail	-5

	The modifiers in the table are cumulative--total the modifiers for all conditions that apply and combine that with the tracker's Wisdom score to get the modified chance to track.
	For example, if Thule's Wisdom score is 16 and he is trying to track through mud (+4), at night (-6), during a sleet storm (-5), his chance to track is 9 (16+4-6-5). (Thule is a ranger so he does not suffer the -6 penalty for non-rangers tracking.)
	For tracking to succeed, the creature tracked must leave some type of trail. Thus, it is virtually impossible to track flying or noncorporeal creatures. The DM may allow this in rare instances, but he should also assign substantial penalties to the attempt.  	To track a creature, the character must first find the trail. Indoors, the tracker must have seen the creature in the last 30 minutes and must begin tracking from the place last seen. Outdoors, the tracker must either have seen the creature, have eyewitness reports of its recent movement ("Yup, we saw them orcs just high-tail it up that trail there not but yesterday."), or must have obvious evidence that the creature is in the area (such as a well-used game trail). If these conditions are met, a proficiency check is rolled. Success means a trail has been found. Failure means no trail has been found. Another attempt cannot be made until the above conditions are met again under different circumstances.
	Once the trail is found, additional proficiency checks are rolled for the following situations:
 	 The chance to track decreases (terrain, rain, creatures leaving the group, darkness, etc.).
 	 A second track crosses the first.
 	 The party resumes tracking after a halt (to rest, eat, fight, etc.).
	Once the tracker fails a proficiency check, another check can be rolled after spending at least one hour searching the area for new signs. If this check is failed, no further attempts can be made. If several trackers are following a trail, a +1 bonus is added to the ability score of the most adept tracker. Once he loses the trail, it is lost to all.  If the modifiers lower the chance to track below 0 (for example, the modifiers are -11 and the character's Wisdom is 10), the trail is totally lost to that character and further tracking is impossible (even if the chance later improves). Other characters may be able to continue tracking, but that character cannot.
	A tracking character can also attempt to identify the type of creatures being followed and the approximate number by rolling a proficiency check. All the normal tracking modifiers apply. One identifying check can be rolled each time a check is rolled to follow the trail. A successful check identifies the creatures (provided the character has some knowledge of that type of creature) and gives a rough estimate of their numbers. Just how accurate this estimate is depends on the DM.
	When following a trail, the character (and those with him) must slow down, the speed depending on the character's modified chance to track as found from the table above.

Movement While Tracking

	Chance to Track		Movement Rate
		1-6	1/4 normal
		7-14	1/4 normal
	14 or greater	3/4 normal

	In the earlier example, Thule has a modified tracking chance of 9, so he moves at 1/2 his normal movement rate.
	Tumbling: The character is practiced in all manner of acrobatics--dives, rolls, somersaults, handstands, flips, etc. Tumbling can only be performed while burdened with light encumbrance or less. Aside from entertaining, the character with tumbling proficiency can improve his Armor Class by 4 against attacks directed solely at him in any round of combat, provided he has the initiative and foregoes all attacks that round. When in unarmed combat he can improve his attack roll by 2.
	On a successful proficiency check, he suffers only one-half the normal damage from falls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of 10 feet or less. Falls from greater heights result in normal damage.
	Ventriloquism: The character has learned the secrets of "throwing his voice." Although not actually making sound come from somewhere else (like the spell), the character can deceive others into believing this to be so. When using ventriloquism, the supposed source of the sound must be relatively close to the character. The nature of the speaking object and the intelligence of those watching can modify the character's chance of success. If the character makes an obviously inanimate object talk (a book, mug, etc.), a -5 penalty is applied to his ability score. If a believable source (a PC or NPC) is made to appear to speak, a +2 bonus is added to his ability score. The observer's intelligence modifies this as follows:

	Intelligence		Modifier
	less than 3		   +6
	     3-5		   +4
	     6-8		   +2
	     9-14		     0
	   15-16		    -1
	   17-18		    -2
	     19+		    -4
	A successful proficiency check means the character has successfully deceived his audience. One check must be made for every sentence or response. The character is limited to sounds he could normally make (thus, the roar of a lion is somewhat beyond him).
	Since ventriloquism relies on deception, people's knowledge of speech, and assumptions about what should and shouldn't talk, it is effective only on intelligent creatures. Thus, it has no effect on animals and the like. Furthermore, the audience must be watching the character since part of the deception is visual ("Hey, his lips don't move!"). Using ventriloquism to get someone to look behind him does not work, since the voice is not actually behind him (this requires the ventriloquism spell). All but those with the gullibility of children realize what is truly happening. They may be amused--or they may not be.
	Veterinary Medicine:  A character proficient in veterinary medicine knows how to use natural medicines and basic principles of first aid and doctoring, as they apply to animals. If the character tends to an animal within one round of wounding (and makes a successful proficiency check), his ministrations restore 1d3 hit points (but no more hit points can be restored than were lost in the previous round). Only one healing attempt can be made per day.  If a wounded animal remains under the care of someone with veterinary medicine proficiency, that animal can recover lost hit points at the rate of 1 per day even when traveling or engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the wounded animal gets complete rest, it can recover 2 hit points per day while under such care. This care does not require a proficiency check, only the regular attention of the proficient character. Up to four patients can be cared for at any time.  A character with veterinary medicine proficiency can also attempt to aid a poisoned animal, provided the poison entered through a wound. If the poisoned animal can be tended to immediately (the round after the animal is poisoned) and the care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a +2 bonus to its saving throw (delay its saving throw until the last round of tending). No proficiency check is required, but the poisoned animal must be tended to immediately (normally by sacrificing any other action by the proficient character) and cannot do anything itself. If the care and rest are interrupted, the poisoned animal must immediately roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result is unalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't help). Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can attempt the same treatment for poisons the victim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his healing to diagnose the poison and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a purgative).  A character with veterinary medicine proficiency can also attempt to diagnose and treat diseases of animals. When dealing with normal diseases, a successful proficiency check automatically reduces the disease to its mildest form and shortest duration. Those who also have herbalism knowledge gain an additional +2 bonus to this check. A proficient character can also attempt to deal with magical diseases, whether caused by spells or creatures. In this case, a successful proficiency check diagnoses the cause of the disease. However, since the disease is magical in nature, it can be treated only by magical means.
	Weaponsmithing: This highly specialized proficiency enables a character to perform the difficult and highly exacting work involved in making metal weapons, particularly those with blades. The character blends some of the skill of the blacksmith with an ability to create blades of strength and sharpness. A fully equipped smithy is necessary to use this proficiency.
	Weather Sense: This proficiency enables the character to make intelligent guesses about upcoming weather conditions. A successful proficiency check means the character has correctly guessed the general weather conditions in the next six hours. A failed check means the character read the signs wrong and forecast the weather incorrectly. The DM should roll the check secretly. A proficiency check can be made once every six hours. However, for every six hours of observation, the character gains a +1 bonus to his ability score (as he watches the weather change, the character gets a better sense of what is coming). This modifier is cumulative, although sleep or other activity that occupies the attention of the character for a long period negates any accumulated bonus.
	Sometimes impending weather conditions are so obvious that no proficiency check is required. It is difficult not to notice the tornado funnel tearing across the plain or the mass of dark clouds on the horizon obviously headed the character's way. In these cases, the player should be able to deduce what is about to happen to his character anyway.
	Weaving: A character with weaving proficiency is able to create garments, tapestries, and draperies from wool or cotton. The character requires a spinning apparatus and a loom. A weaver can create two square yards of material per day.
     Woodworking : Complementary to carpentry, the woodworking proficiency enables a character to be able to create intricate items from wood, barrels, large items such as ships, and other transport vehicles.  A woodworker can also make wooden wheels, moving parts, axles, gears and the like.  As with any other manufacturing type proficiency, the character must have the proper tools in order to have any chance of success at all. 

Notes regarding nonweapon proficiencies : 
     Psychology : A character who has proficiency in psychology of a given race need only spend one slot to gain proficiency for an additional race. 
     Survival : A character with the secondary skill of  "Expert Survivalist" only need expend one proficiency slot to gain the survival proficiency in a different type of terrain.  It is pointless for an expert survivalist to take a nonweapon proficiency in survival for the terrain/climate in which he or she is an expert; the secondary skill already covers the nonweapon proficiency and beyond.
 
Secondary Skills :
     Characters may have a secondary skill if desired.  A secondary skill is a profession which the character would have as a life profession; a character may only ever have one secondary skill.  The skill can be anything that a person might reasonably do for a living as a professional.  A character with a secondary skill which is of the same name as a proficiency, will be vastly better at it than the character with a nonweapon proficiency.  Exact secondary skills must be discussed with the DM. You must submit a written history as to why your character has such a secondary skill to the DM, and it must be approved as acceptable by the DM, or else your character may not have a secondary skill.  It is recommended that you type such a document using a word processor and print it on a standard 8.5" x 11" sheet of good paper, as it will be added to your character sheet if approved by the DM.
     Note : A secondary skill as a metalsmith includes a knowledge of metallurgy.

Character Background:
   All characters have some sort of background as to what and who they were before becoming an adventurer.  It is the player's responsibility to come up with a reasonable background for each character.  Most player characters will be from the lower or middle class, very few of any other social status have reason to become adventurers.  Note that any character background must be discussed with the Dungeon Master first, and it may actually benefit the character in the long run to have a detailed history.




Chapter 6: 
Money and Equipment

Although your character has some impressive abilities and skills, he really isn't going to be effective without the equipment necessary for adventuring. To get this equipment, he needs money. Not only does he need money to outfit himself, but your character also has to cover his living expenses.
	The basic coins are the copper piece (cp) and the silver piece (sp). These form the backbone of the monetary system and are the coins most frequently found in the hands of the common folk. Above these two coins is the much rarer gold piece (gp). This coin is seldom found in common use.  In addition to these coins, there are other unusual metals used in exchange.	However, remember that not all wealth is measured by coins. Wealth can take many forms. Coins have no guaranteed value. A gold piece can buy a lot in a small village but won't go very far in a large city. This makes other forms of wealth, land for instance, all the more valuable.  This world operates on a "silver standard"; i.e. the standard coin of exchange, unlike the generic AD&D world, is the silver piece.
     
Standard Exchange Rates
						Exchange Value
Coin	CP	SP	 GP	 PP
Copper Piece (CP) =	    1	1/10	1/100	1/1000
Silver Piece (SP) =	  10	  1	1/10	1/100
Gold Piece (GP) =	100	10	  1	1/10
Platinum Piece (PP) =	1000	100	 10	  1
    or :     10 cp = 1 sp = 1/10 gp = 1/100 pp                   

Starting Money 
Initial character starting money and equipment :
     As DM, I allow characters to start with reasonable equipment, plus 3d6x10 silver pieces.  Reasonable equipment definitely does not include such things as mounts, pack animals, plate armor, houses and property, wagons, rare spell components, and the like.  If there is a question whether an item is considered as reasonable equipment, ask.  I require all starting characters' equipment lists to be shown to me before the character enters play.

Starting Money and Equipment for Condottieri :
     Since every condottiere is assumed to have been a member of a training academy before becoming an adventuring character, a condottiere begins with equipment beyond that which is available to other characters at the start of their career.  This equipment is given to the condottiere by his or her master and trainer at the academy attended.  For each condottiere, roll 1d100 for equipment, and consult the table below :

d100 result                          Starting Equipment
  01 - 20                          20 - 50 sp, scale mail, sword1, dagger, lance7, and light riding horse.
  21 - 35                          20 - 80 sp, scale mail, sword1, dagger, lance7, shield5, and medium riding horse.
  36 - 65                          30 - 100 sp, chain mail3, sword1, dagger, lance7, shield5, shortbow6, and medium
                                             riding horse.
  66 - 80                          50 - 120 sp, chain mail3, sword2,  dagger, shield5, lance7, shortbow6, weapon9,
                                             and light warhorse.
  81 - 90                          70 - 120 sp, chain mail4, sword2, dagger, shield5, lance7, bow8, weapon9, and
                                             medium warhorse.
  91 - 98                          80 - 150 sp, chain mail4, sword2, dagger, shield5, bow8, lance10, weapon9(x2),
                                              and heavy warhorse.
  99 - 00                          130 - 180 sp, armor11, sword2, dagger, shield5, bow8, lance10, weapon9 (x3),

Making Money
     Since the area in which the characters are adventuring is a frontier like environment, money is a rather flexible thing.  There is no real "standard coin of the realm", so to speak.  Any competent metalsmith may manufacture coinage, so long as it contains the proper weight and purity  of the appropriate metal, as defined by the common merchants' standards.  So long as it is "good" coinage, it will be accepted as money, regardless of who actually coined it.  Nearly all of the coins used on the continent are valued solely by their content of precious metal.  Those manufactured within the merchants' standards for such coins are more readily accepted, however, and all such coins have the coat of arms of the city of manufacture on them.  This, however, does not imply that the coin was actually struck in the city itself, rather, it is an indication that the metalsmith who coined it is given the authority to make coinage for the city.  Coins other than those which are officially manufactured do exist, however, their values are questionable, and are usually devalued by impurities.  These coins are valued at whatever you can get for them, which is generally slightly less than the value of the metal.  Counterfeiting is not only a bad idea, but is next to impossible, since every merchant, metalsmith, and dwarf will be able to determine with ease whether a coin is within standards, and the penalties, though variable depending on to whom you pass bad money, is generally always very severe and always harmful to the health and lifestyle of the character who passes bad money. 

Equipment Lists and Descriptions 
     There is no "standard" equipment list.  After your character is created, if you want to buy equipment, it is a matter of where you go, and how you role-play the situation and encounter as to whether the equipment is available and how much it costs.   If you are a good role-player, and not a chart-dependent roll-player, you don't need a "standard" equipment list.   There is no way that I am going to describe in this book every piece of equipment used in my campaign world.  If you are unsure, and want to know, look in the Players Handbook; if you can not find it there, ask the DM.

Notes regarding the Weapons Damage Table :
     1: These weapons will inflict twice the indicated damage to any opponent when the weapon is set to receive their charge.
     2: These weapons will inflict twice the indicated damage to any opponent when employed by an attacker riding a charging mount, or when the weapon is set to receive an opponent's charge.
     3: These weapons may be used in the "off" hand of a wielder at least 4 1/2 feet tall, as per Attacking with  Two Weapons.
     4: These weapons may be wielded either one-handed or two-handed, however, the character must be at least 5 1/2 feet tall and must have a strength score of at least 18 in order to wield the weapon in one hand; and if the weapon is wielded one-handed, the character's strength bonuses "to hit" and damage do not apply.
     5: The condottiere and monk classes have special damage for open hand weaponless combat; refer to the specific class descriptions for these.
     Partisan includes ranseur and spetum.
     General Note : Any weapon strikes at +2 "to hit" against an opponent's back ( or similarly unseen ); Against stunned, prone, and relatively motionless targets, any weapon strikes at +4 "to hit"; Against any completely helpless target, any weapon scores an automatic hit.

Non-Standard Weapons : 
     There are many things that characters will use as weapons.  Personally, I have seen such things as crowbars, table legs, boards, shovels, sledgehammers, rocks, frying pans, and other items like these used as weapons by player characters.  There are no charts for such non-standard items, nor will there ever be.  The DM is inventive enough to come up with on the spot stats for them.  For those of you who want an example of statistics for non-standard weapons, a good reference can be found in Dragon Magazine #97, the article entitled "Sticks, Stones, and Bones ... ", relative to non-standard things used as weapons.

Creatures with Natural Armor Classes
	Some creatures possess a natural Armor Class already superior to some of the armor types (for example, the horse is AC 7). However, these creatures can still benefit from wearing armor of a quality worse than their natural Armor Class. If the AC of armor is equal to or worse than the AC of the creature, the AC of the creature improves by 1.
	For example, a horse has a natural AC of 7. The AC of leather armor is 8, worse than the horse's natural AC. However, if a horse is fitted with leather barding, its AC drops to 6 since it gains the benefit of the additional protection.

Encumbrance 
	A natural desire is to have your character own one of everything. Thus equipped, your character could just reach into his pack and pull out any item he wants whenever he needs it. Sadly, there are limits to how much your character, his horse, his mule, his elephant, or his whatever can carry. These limits are determined by encumbrance.
	Encumbrance is measured in pounds. To calculate encumbrance, simply total the pounds of gear carried by the creature or character. Add five pounds for clothing, if any is worn. This total is then compared to the carrying capacity of the creature to determine the effects. In general, the more weight carried, the slower the movement and the worse the character is at fighting.

Specific Encumbrance
     The specific expanded encumbrance table (Modified Movement Rates), below, is used.

Magic and Encumbrance
    Magic items have the same encumbrance as a normal item of the same type.  All magical items start out as exceptional normal items before becoming enchanted.  The magical dweomer only affects how the item performs, or what it has the capability to do, not how much it weighs.

Effects of Encumbrance
    An encumbered character loses the ability to move as freely as he or she normally is able, therefore, the following modifiers affect heavily encumbered characters.
     If a character is encumbered to the point of being reduced in movement to any extent less than the characters normal movement base, the character loses all applicable dexterity bonuses, and for each step more encumbered the character is, a penalty of +1 to armor class and initiative apply to the encumbered character.
     Example : Fred the half-elf fighter has a strength of 18/78 and a dexterity of 16, and so he can carry 185 pounds before becoming hindered by his load.  If Fred carries 205 pounds, he loses his dexterity bonus, and is penalized by +2 to armor class, and has a +2 modifier to his initiative unless he drops some of his extra items.  If Fred is carrying 320 pounds, he loses dexterity bonus and has a +11 to armor class and initiative due to so much weight.  Clearly, it becomes very important to keep one's load as light as practical.
     Aside from knowing the weight limits, your character needs to have ways to hold all his gear.  Since all player characters are adventurers, it is assumed they know the best methods for packing and stowing equipment. Blankets are rolled into bedrolls, small items are carefully arranged, rope is properly coiled, weapons are slung in the most comfortable manner, etc. While small items can be easily stuffed into a pack, large bulky things may encumber more than their actual weight would indicate. The DM has the right to rule that an object is more encumbering than it actually appears.




Chapter 7: 
Magic 

Some of the most powerful weapons player characters have at their disposal in the AD&D game are magical spells. Through spells a player character can control earthquakes, call lightning out of the sky, heal grievous injuries, hurl explosive balls of fire, create barriers of stone, fire, and ice, and learn secrets long forgotten. These are only a few of the things player characters can do once they master the strange lore of spells.
	Not every character is capable of casting spells, however. This ability requires a certain amount of aptitude, depending on the type of spells cast. Magic user spells are best mastered by those with keen intelligence and patience for the long years of study that are required. Cleric spells call for inner peace and faith and an intense devotion to one's calling.
	The vast majority of people in a fantasy campaign lack these traits or have never had the opportunity to develop them. The baker may be a bright and clever fellow, but, following in his father's footsteps, he has spent his life learning the arts of bread making. There has simply been no time in his life for the study of old books and crumbling scrolls. The hard-working peasant may be pious and upright in his faith, but he lacks the time for the contemplative and scholarly training required of a cleric. So it is only a fortunate few who have the ability and opportunity to learn the arcane lore of spellcasting.
	A few character classes have a limited ability to cast spells. The ranger, through his close association with nature, is able to cast a few spells, though his choices are limited to his natural inclinations. The paladin, through his devotion and humility, can use some of the spells of the cleric. The bard, through luck, happenstance, curiosity, and perseverance, can manage a few magic user spells, perhaps by persuading a lonely magic user to reveal his secrets.
	Regardless of their source, all spells fall into the general categories of magic user or cleric. Although some spells appear in both categories, in general the categories differ in how spells are acquired, stored, and cast.
     Spell casters must sleep uninterrupted for a minimum of eight consecutive hours in order to have the mental revitalization to be able to memorize spells.  This applies to all types of casters, including paladins, rangers, and bards who are of a high enough experience level to be able to cast spells.
Spell casters who are rendered unconscious by wounds lose all spells which they had previously memorized due to the shock of near-death.  Clerics who go to sleep lose all spells which they had previously memorized as their minds revitalize and prepare to receive new spells (this helps with daily devotions to the cleric's god, as well).  Magic users may choose to retain any uncast spells when they go to sleep, but if they do so, they may not memorize any additional spells once they awaken.  They will still have the same spells as when they went to sleep.  Alternatively, a magic user can choose to clear his mind of all uncast spells in order to revitalize and procure more spells.  A magic user who does this has no spells upon awakening, and thus must study in order to have any spells whatsoever.

Cleric Spells 
The spells of a cleric, while sometimes having powers similar to those of the magic user, are quite different in their overall tone. The cleric's role, more often than not, is as defender and guide for others. Thus, the majority of his spells work to aid others or provide some service to the community in which he lives. Few of his spells are truly offensive, but many can be used cleverly to protect or defend.
	Like the magic user, the cleric's level determines how many spells he retains. He must select these spells in advance, demonstrating his wisdom and far-sightedness by choosing those spells he thinks will be most useful in the trials that lurk ahead.
	Unlike the magic user, the cleric needs no spell book and does not roll to see if he learns spells. Cleric spells are obtained in an entirely different manner. To obtain his spells, a cleric must be faithful to the cause of his deity. If the cleric feels confident in this (and most do), he can pray for his spells. Through prayer, the cleric humbly and politely requests those spells he wishes to memorize. Under normal circumstances, these spells are then granted.
	A cleric's spell selection is limited by his level and by the different spheres of spells. (The spheres of influence, into which cleric spells are divided, can be found under "Clerics of a Specific Mythoi" in Chapter 3: player Character Classes.) Within the major spheres of his deity, a cleric can use any spell of a given level when he is able to cast spells of that level.   For spells belonging to the minor spheres of the cleric's deity, he can cast spells only up to 3rd level. The knowledge of what spells are available to the cleric becomes instantly clear as soon as he advances in level. This, too, is bestowed by his deity.
	Clerics must pray to obtain spells, as they are requesting their abilities from some greater power, be it their deity or some intermediary agent of this power. The conditions for praying are identical to those needed for the magic user's studying. Clearly then, it behooves the cleric to maintain himself in good standing with this power, through word and deed. Clerics who slip in their duties, harbor indiscreet thoughts, or neglect their beliefs, find that their deity has an immediate method of redress. If the cleric has failed in his duties, the deity can deny him spells as a clear message of dissatisfaction. For minor infractions, the deity can deny minor spells. Major failings result in the denial of major spells or, even worse, all spells. These can be regained if the character immediately begins to make amends for his errors. Perhaps the character only needs to be a little more vigilant, in the case of a minor fault. A serious transgression could require special service, such as a quest or some great sacrifice of goods. These are things your DM will decide, should your character veer from the straight and narrow path of his religion.
	Finally, your DM may rule that not all deities are equal, so that those of lesser power are unable to grant certain spells. If this optional rule is used, powers of demi-god status can only grant spells up to the 5th spell level. Lesser deities can grant 6th-level spells, while the greater deities have all spell levels available to them. You should inquire about this at the time you create your character (and decide which deity he worships), to prevent any unwelcome surprises later on.

Magic User Spells 
Magic user spells range from spells of simple utility to great and powerful magics. The magic user spell group has no single theme or purpose. The vast majority of magic user spells were created by ancient magic users for many different purposes. Some are to serve the common man in his everyday needs. Others provide adventurers with the might and firepower they need to survive. Some are relatively simple and safe to use (as safe as magic can be); others are complicated, filled with hazards and snares for the rash and unwary. Perhaps the greatest of all magic user spells is the powerful and tricky wish. It represents the epitome of spell-casting--causing things to happen simply because the magic user desires it to be so. But it is a long and difficult task to attain the mastery needed to learn this spell.
	Although some characters can use spells, the workings of magic are dimly understood at best. There are many theories about where the power comes from. The most commonly accepted idea is that the mysterious combination of words, gestures, and materials that make up a spell somehow taps an extradimensional source of energy that in turn causes the desired effect. Somehow the components of the spells--those words, gestures and materials--route this energy to a specific and desired result. Fortunately, how this happens is not very important to the majority of magic users. It is enough to know that "when you do this, that happens."
	Casting a magic user spell is a very complicated ordeal. The process of learning the correct procedure to cast a spell is difficult and taxing to the mind. Thus, a magic user must check to see if he learns each new spell. Furthermore, there is a limit to just how much of this strangeness--illogical mathematics, alchemical, chemistry, structuralist linguistics--a magic user's mind can comprehend, and so he must live with a limit to the number of spells he can know.
	As the magic user learns spells, he records their arcane notes into his spell books. Without spell books, a magic user cannot memorize new spells. Within them are all his instructions for memorizing and casting all the spells he knows. As the magic user successfully learns a new spell, he carefully enters its formula into his spell books. A magic user can never have a spell in his books that he does not know, because if he doesn't understand it, he cannot write the formula. Likewise, he cannot enter a spell into his books that is higher in level than he can cast. If he finds an ancient tome with spells of higher power, he must simply wait until he advances to a level at which he can use them.
	The exact shape and size of a character's spellbooks is a detail your DM will provide. They may be thick tomes of carefully inked parchment, crackling scrolls in bulky cases, or even weighty clay tablets. They are almost never convenient to carry around. Their exact form depends on the type and setting of the campaign world your DM has created.
	Ultimately, it is the memorization that is important. To draw on magical energy, the magic user must shape specific mental patterns in his mind. He uses his spell books to force his mind through mental exercises, preparing it to hold the final, twisted patterns. These patterns are very complicated and alien to normal thought, so they don't register in the mind as normal learning. To shape these patterns, the magic user must spend time memorizing the spell, twisting his thoughts and recasting the energy patterns each time to account for subtle changes--planetary motions, seasons, time of day, and more.
	Once a magic user memorizes a spell, it remains in his memory (as potential energy) until he uses the prescribed components to trigger the release of the energy patterns. The mental patterns apparently release the energy while the components shape and guide it. Upon casting, the energy of the spell is spent, wiped clean from the magic user's mind. The mental patterns are lost until the magic user studies and memorizes that spell again.
	The number of spells a magic user can memorize is given by his level; he cannot memorize the same spell more than once. Part of a magic user's intelligence can be seen in the careful selection of spells he has memorized.  Memorization is not a thing that happens immediately. The magic user must have a clear head gained from a restful night's sleep and then has to spend time studying his spell books. The amount of study time needed is 10 minutes per level of the spell being memorized. Thus, a 9th-level spell (the most powerful) would require 90 minutes of careful study. Clearly, high-level spellcasters do not lightly change their memorized spells.  Spells remain memorized until they are cast or wiped from the character's mind by injury to the point of unconsciousness, the magic user choosing to clear his mind before a nights rest, a spell or magical item. A magic user cannot choose to forget just one or a few memorized spells to replace it with another one. He can, however, clear all memorized spells prior to going to sleep in order to refresh the spells memorized.

Schools of Magic 
	Although all magic user spells are learned and memorized the same way, they fall into nine different schools of magic. A school of magic is a group of related spells.
	Abjuration spells are a group of specialized protective spells. Each is used to prevent or banish some magical or nonmagical effect or creature. They are often used to provide safety in times of great danger or when attempting some other particularly dangerous spell.
	Alteration spells cause a change in the properties of some already existing thing, creature, or condition. This is accomplished by magical energy channeled through the magic user.
	Conjuration/summoning spells bring something to the caster from elsewhere. Conjuration normally produces matter or items from some other place. Summoning enables the caster to compel living creatures and powers to appear in his presence or to channel extraplanar energies through himself.
	Enchantment/charm spells cause a change in the quality of an item or the attitude of a person or creature. Enchantments can bestow magical properties on ordinary items, while charms can unduly influence the behavior of beings.
	Greater divinations are more powerful than lesser divinations (see below). These spells enable the magic user to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, and to uncover things hidden or cloaked by spells.
	Illusions deal with spells to deceive the senses or minds of others. Spells that cause people to see things that are not there, hear noises not made, or remember things that never happened are all illusions.
	Invocation/Evocation spells channel magical energy to create specific effects and materials. Invocation normally relies on the intervention of some higher agency (to whom the spell is addressed), while evocation enables the caster to directly shape the energy.
	Lesser divination spells are learnable by all magic users, regardless of their affiliation. This school includes the most basic and vital spells of the magic user--those he needs to practice other aspects of his craft. Lesser divinations include read magic and detect magic.
	Necromancy is one of the most restrictive of all spell schools. It deals with dead things or the restoration of life, limbs, or vitality to living creatures. Although a small school, its spells tend to be powerful. Given the risks of the adventuring world, necromantic spells are considered quite useful.



Learning Spells 
	Whether a character chooses to be a magic user or a specialist in one of the schools of magic, he must learn his spells from somewhere. While it might be possible for the exceptional magic user to learn the secrets of arcane lore entirely on his own, it isn't very likely. It is far more likely that your character was apprenticed to another magic user as a lad. This kindly (severe), loving (callous), understanding (ill-tempered), generous (mean-spirited), and upright (untrustworthy) master taught your character everything he knows at the start of the game. Then, when it was time, the master sent him into the world (threw him out) with a smile and a pat on the back (snarling with his foot on your character's behind).
	Or perhaps your character studied at a proper academy for magic users (if your DM has such things). There he completed his lessons under the eye of a firm (mean) but patient (irritable) tutor who was ready with praise for good work (a cane for the slightest fault). But alas, your character's parents were impoverished and his studies had to end (fed up with this treatment, your youthful character fled during the night).
	As you can see, there are a number of ways your character might have learned his spells.
	The one good thing that comes from your character's studies is his initial spell book. It may have been a gift from his school or he may have stolen it from his hated master. Whatever the case, your character begins play with a spell book containing up to a few 1st-level spells. Your DM will tell you the exact number of spells and which spells they are. As your character adventures, he will have the opportunity to add more spells to his collection.
	When your character attains a new level, he may or may not receive new spells. This is up to your DM. He may allow your character to return to his mentor (provided he departed on good terms!) and add a few spells to his book. It may be possible for your character to copy spells from the spell book of another player character (with his permission, of course). Or he may have to wait until he can find a spell book with new spells. How he gets his spells is one of the things your DM decides.
	In al cases, before he can add a new spell to his spell book, you have to check to see if your character learns that spell. The chance of learning a spell depends on your magic user's Intelligence, as given in Table 4. This chance may be raised or lowered if your character is a specialist.

Illusions 
	Of all spells, those of the illusion school cause the most problems. Not that they are more difficult for your player character to cast, but these spells are more difficult for you to role-play and for your DM to adjudicate. Illusions rely on the idea of believability, which in turn relies on the situation and the state of mind of the victim. Your DM must determine this for NPCs, which is perhaps an easier job. You must role-play this for your character.
	Spells of this school fall into two basic groups. Illusions are creations that manipulate light, color, shadow, sound, and sometimes even scent. Higher level illusions tap energy from other planes, and are actually quasi-real, being woven of extradimensional energies by the caster. Common illusions create appearances; they cannot make a creature or object look like nothing (i.e., invisible), but they can conceal objects by making them look like something else.
	Phantasms exist only in the minds of their victims; these spells are never even quasi-real. (The exceptions to this are the phantasmal force spells, which are actually illusions rather than phantasms.) Phantasms act upon the mind of the victim to create an intense reaction--fear being most common.
	The key to successful illusions or phantasms is believability, which depends on three main factors: what the caster attempts, what the victim expects, and what is happening at the moment the spell is cast. By combining the information from these three areas, the player and the DM should be able to create and adjudicate reasonable illusions and phantasms.
	When casting an illusion or phantasm, the caster can attempt to do anything he desires within the physical limits of the spell. Prior knowledge of the illusion created is not necessary but is extremely useful.
	The type of image chosen by the caster affects the reaction of the victim. Thus, spellcasters are well-advised to create images of things they have seen, for the same reason authors are advised to write about things they know.  The next important consideration is to ask if the spell creates something that the victim expects. Which of these two illusions would be more believable--a huge dragon rising up behind a rank of attacking kobolds (puny little creatures) or a few ogres forming a line behind the kobolds? Most adventurers would find it hard to believe that a dragon would be working with kobolds. The dragon is far too powerful to associate with such little shrimps. Ogres, however, could very well work with kobolds--bossing them around and using them as cannon fodder. The key to a good illusion is to create something the victim does not expect but can quickly accept.
	The most believable illusion may be that of a solid wall in a dungeon, transforming a passage into a dead end. Unless the victim is familiar with these hallways, he has no reason not to believe that the wall is there.
	Of course, in a fantasy world many more things can be believed than in the real world. Flames do not spring out of nowhere in the real world, but this can happen in a fantasy world. The presence of magic in a fantasy world makes victims more willing to accept things our logic tells us cannot happen. A creature appearing out of nowhere could be an illusion or it could be summoned. At the same time, you must remember that a properly role-played character is familiar with the laws of his world. If a wall of flames appears out of nowhere, he will look for the spellcaster. A wall blocking a corridor may cause him to check for secret doors. If the illusion doesn't conform to his idea of how things work, the character should become suspicious. This is something you have to provide for your character and something you must remember when your character attempts to use illusions.
	This then leads to the third factor in the believability of an illusion, how appropriate the illusion is for the situation. As mentioned before, the victim is going to have certain expectations about any given encounter. The best illusions reinforce these expectations to your character's advantage. Imagine that your group runs into a war party of orcs in the local forest. What could you do that would reinforce what the orcs might already believe? They see your group, armed and ready for battle. They do not know if you are alone or are the advance guard for a bigger troop. A good illusion could be the glint of metal and spear points coming up behind your party. Subtlety has its uses. The orcs will likely interpret your illusion as reinforcements to your group, enough to discourage them from attacking.
	However, the limitations of each spell must be considered when judging appropriateness. A phantasmal force spell creates vision only. It does not provide sound, light, or heat. In the preceding situation, creating a troop of soldiers galloping up behind you would not have been believable. Where is the thunder of hooves, the creak of saddle leather, the shouts of your allies, the clank of drawn metal, or the whinny of horses? Orcs may  not be tremendously bright, but they are not fooled that easily. Likewise, a dragon that suddenly appears without a thunderous roar and dragonish stench isn't likely to be accepted as real. A wise spellcaster always considers the limitations of his illusions and finds ways to hide their weaknesses from the enemy.
	An illusion spell, therefore, depends on its believability. Believability is determined by the situation and a saving throw. Under normal circumstances, those observing the illusion are allowed a saving throw vs. spell if they actively disbelieve the illusion. For player characters, disbelieving is an action in itself and takes a round. For NPCs and monsters, a normal saving throw is made if the DM deems it appropriate. The DM can give bonuses or penalties to this saving throw as he thinks appropriate. If the caster has cleverly prepared a realistic illusion, this certainly results in penalties on the victim's saving throw. If the victim were to rely more on scent than sight, on the other hand, it could gain bonuses to its saving throw. If the saving throw is passed, the victim sees the illusion for what it is. If the saving throw is failed, the victim believes the illusion. A good indication of when player characters should receive a positive modifier to their saving throws is when they say they don't believe what they see, especially if they can give reasons why.
	There are rare instances when the saving throw may automatically succeed or fail. There are times when the illusion created is either so perfect or so utterly fantastic as to be impossible even in a fantasy world. Be warned, these occasions are very rare and you should not expect your characters to benefit from them more than once or twice.
	In many encounters, some party members will believe an illusion while others see it for what it really is. In these cases, revealing the truth to those deluded by the spell is not a simple matter of telling them. The magic of the spell has seized their minds. Considered from their point of view, they se a horrible monster (or whatever) while a friend is telling them it isn't real. They know magic can affect people's minds, but whose mind has been affected in this case? At best, having an illusion pointed out grants another saving throw with a +4 bonus.
	Illusions do have other limitations. The caster must maintain a show of reality at all times when conducting an illusion. (If a squad of low-level fighters is created, the caster dictates their hits, misses, damage inflicted, apparent wounds, and so forth, and the referee decides whether the bounds of believability have been exceeded.) Maintaining an illusion normally requires concentration on the part of the caster, preventing him from doing other things. Disturb him and the illusion vanishes.
	Illusions are spells of trickery and deceit, not damage and destruction. Thus, illusions cannot be used to cause real damage. When a creature is caught in the blast of an illusionary fireball or struck by the claws of an illusionary troll, he thinks he takes damage. The DM should record the illusionary damage (but tell the player his character has taken real damage). If the character takes enough damage to "die," he collapses in a faint. A system shock roll should be made for the character. (His mind, believing the damage to be real, may cause his body to cease functioning!) If the character survives, he regains consciousness after 1d3 turns with his illusionary damage healed. In most cases, the character quickly realizes that it was all an illusion.
	When an illusion creates a situation of inescapable death, such as a giant block dropping from the ceiling, all those believing the illusion must roll for system shock. If they fail, they die--killed by the sheer terror of the situation. If they pass, they are allowed a new saving throw with a +4 bonus. Those who pass recognize the illusion for what it is. Those who fail faint for 1d3 turns.
	Illusions do not enable characters to defy normal physical laws. An illusionary bridge cannot support a character who steps on it, even if he believes the bridge is real. An illusionary wall does not actually cause a rock thrown at it to bounce off. However, affected creatures attempt to simulate the reality of what they see as much as possible. A character who falls into an illusionary pit drops to the ground as if he had fallen. A character may lean against an illusionary wall, not realizing that he isn't actually putting his weight on it. If the same character were suddenly pushed, he would find himself falling through the very wall he thought was solid!
	Illusions of creatures do not automatically behave like those creatures, nor do they have those creatures' powers. This depends on the caster's ability and the victim's knowledge of the creatures. Illusionary creatures fight using the caster's combat ability. They take damage and die when their caster dictates it. An illusory orc could continue to fight, showing no damage, even after it had been struck a hundred or a thousand times. Of course, long before this its attackers will become suspicious. Illusionary creatures can have whatever special abilities the caster can make appear (i.e., a dragon's fiery breath or a troll's regeneration), but they do not necessarily have unseen special abilities. There is no way a caster can create the illusion of a basilisk's gaze that turns people to stone. However, these abilities might be manifested through the fears of the victims. For example, Rath the fighter meets an illusionary basilisk. Rath has fought these beasties before and knows what they can do. His gaze accidentally locks with that of the basilisk. Primed by his own fears, Rath must make a system shock roll to remain alive. But if Rath had never seen a basilisk and had no idea that the creature's gaze could turn him to stone, there is no way his mind could generate the fear necessary to kill him. Sometimes ignorance is bliss!

Casting Spells 
Both magic users and clerics use the same rules for casting spells. To cast a spell, the character must first have the spell memorized. If it is not memorized, the spell cannot be cast. The caster must be able to speak (not under the effects of a silence spell or gagged) and have both arms free.  If the spell is targeted on a person, place, or thing, the caster must be able to see the target. It is not enough to cast a fireball 150 feet ahead into the darkness; the caster must be able to see the point of explosion and the intervening distance. Likewise, a magic missile (which always hits its target) cannot be fired into a group of bandits with the instruction to strike the leader; the caster must be able to identify and see the leader.
	Once the casting has begun, the character must stand still. Casting cannot be accomplished while riding a roughly moving beast or a vehicle, unless special efforts are made to stabilize and protect the caster. Thus, a spell cannot be cast from the back of a galloping horse under any conditions, nor can a magic user or cleric cast a spell on the deck of a ship during a storm. However, if the caster were below decks, protected from the wind and surging waves, he could cast a spell. While it is not normally possible to cast a spell from a moving chariot, a character who was steadied and supported by others could do so. Your DM will have to make a ruling in these types of extraordinary conditions.
	During the round in which the spell is cast, the caster cannot move to dodge attacks. Therefore, no AC benefit from Dexterity is gained by spellcasters while casting spells. Furthermore, if the spellcaster is struck by a weapon or fails to make a saving throw before the spell is cast, the caster's concentration is disrupted. The spell is lost in a fizzle of useless energy and is wiped clean from the memory of the caster until it can be rememorized. Spellcasters are well advised not to stand at the front of any battle, at least if they want to be able to cast any spells!

Spell Components
	The actions required to cast a spell are divided into three groups: verbal, somatic (gestures), and material. Each spell description lists what combination of these components is needed to cast a spell. Verbal components require the caster to speak clearly (not be silenced in any way); somatic components require free gestures (thus, the caster cannot be bound or held); material components must be tossed, dropped, burned, eaten, broken, or whatever for the spell to work. While there is no specific description of the words and gestures that must be performed, the material components are listed in the spell descriptions. Some of these are common and easy to obtain. Others represent items of great value or scarcity. Whatever the component, it is automatically destroyed or lost when the spell is cast, unless the spell description specifically notes otherwise.
     Magic user spells require all listed components, including material components if the spell description lists them as necessary.  Clerical spells only require verbal and somatic components, plus the cleric's holy symbol.  Spells cast by paladins, rangers, bards, and other such casters are treated as the type of spell which they are.  Without the proper components, he is helpless, even if the spell is memorized.  In all cases, it is perfectly proper for your DM to insist that special efforts be made to obtain these items. After all, you simply cannot assume your character has a valuable pearl handy whenever he needs one!
	The three different aspects of spell components also change the conditions under which your character can cast his spells. No longer does he need to be able to speak, move, and use some item. He only needs to fulfill the required components. Thus, a spell with only a verbal component could be used by a naked, bound spellcaster. One requiring only gestures could be cast even within the radius of a silence spell. Most spells require a combination of components, but clever spellcasters often create new spells that need only a word or a gesture, enabling them to take their enemies by surprise.

Magical Research 
     Spell research by a character will be handled for each individual character by the DM.  While the spell lists for both groups offer a wide variety of tools and effects, the clever player character can quickly get an edge by researching his own spells. Where other spellcasters may fall quickly into tired and predictable patterns , an enterprising character can deliver sudden (and nasty) surprises!
	Although your DM has the rules for handling spell research, there are some things you should know about how to proceed. First and foremost, research means that you and your DM will be working together to expand the game. This is not a job he does for you! Without your input, nothing happens. Second, whatever your character researches, it cannot be more powerful than the spells he is already able to cast. If it is, you must wait until your character can cast spells of an equal power. (Thus, as a 1st-level magic user, you cannot research a spell that is as powerful as a fireball. You must wait until your character can cast a fireball.) Finally, you will have to be patient and willing to have your character spend some money. He won't create the spell immediately, as research takes time. A character attempting magical research absolutely requires access to a library in order to have any chance of success at all.  A magical/alchemy laboratory is also helpful, and as a player, you should expect that such research will also cost your character enormous amounts of money. 
	Knowing these things, you should first write up a description of the spell you want to create. Be sure to include information on components, saving throws, range, duration, and all the other entries you find in the normal spell listings. When you give your DM the written description, tell him what you want the spell to do. (Sometimes what you write isn't really what you mean, and talking to your DM is a good way to prevent confusion.) After this, he will either accept or reject your spell. This is his choice and not all DMs will have the same answer. Don't kick and complain; find out what changes are needed to make the spell acceptable. You can probably iron out the differences.
	Once all these things are done, your character can research the spell. Be ready for this to take some time. Eventually he will succeed, although the spell may not do quite what he expected. Your DM may revise the spell, perhaps reducing the area of effect or damage inflicted. Finally, all you have to do is name your spell. This should be something suitably pompous, such as "Delsenora's Malevolent Steamroller." After all, you want something to impress the locals!


Spell Descriptions 
	The spells are organized according to their group (cleric or magic user) and level, listed in appendices at the end of the text. Within each level, the spells are arranged alphabetically. At the start of each spell description is the following important game information:
	Name: Each spell is identified by name. In parentheses after the name is the school (for magic user spells) to which that spell belongs. When more than one is listed, that spell is common to all schools given.
	Some spells are reversible (they can be cast for an effect opposite to that of the standard spell). This is noted after the spell name. Clerics with reversible spells must memorize the desired version. For example, a cleric who desires a cause light wounds spell must petition for this form of the cure light wounds spell when meditating and praying. Note that severe penalties can result if the spell choice is at variance with the cleric's alignment (possible penalties include denial of specific spells, entire spell levels, or even all spells for a certain period). The exact result (if any) depends on the reaction of the cleric's patron deity, as determined by the DM.
	Reversible magic user spells operate similarly. When the spell is learned, both forms are recorded in the magic user's spell books. However, the magic user must decide which version of the spell he desires to cast when memorizing the spell, unless the spell description specifically states otherwise. For example, a magic user who has memorized stone to flesh and desires to cast flesh to stone must wait until the latter form of the spell can be memorized (i.e., rest eight hours and study). If he could memorize two 6th-level spells, he could memorize each version once or one version twice.
	School: In parentheses after the spell name is the name of the school of magic to which the spell belongs. For magic user spells, this defines which spells a magic user specialist can learn, depending on the magic user's school of specialization. For cleric spells, the school notation is used only for reference purposes, to indicate which school the spell is considered to belong to, in case the DM needs to know for spell resistance (for example, elves' resistance to charm spells).
	Sphere: This entry appears only for cleric spells and identifies the sphere or spheres into which that spell falls.
	Range: This lists the distance from the caster at which the spell effect occurs or begins A "0" indicates the spell can be used on the caster only, with the effect embodied within or emanating from him. "Touch" means the caster can use the spell on others if he can physically touch them. Unless otherwise specified, all other spells are centered on a point visible to the caster and within the range of the spell. The point can be a creature or object if desired. In general, a spell that affects a limited number of creatures within an area affects those closest to the center of the area first, unless there are other parameters operating (such as level or Hit Dice). Spells can be cast through narrow openings only if both the caster's vision and the spell energy can be directed simultaneously through the opening. A magic user standing behind an arrow slit can cast through it; sending a fireball through a small peephole he is peering through is another matter.
	Components: This lists the category of components needed, V for verbal, S for somatic, and M for material. When material components are required, these are listed in the spell description. Spell components are expended as the spell is cast, unless otherwise noted. Cleric holy symbols are not lost when a spell is cast. For cases in which material components are expended at the end of the spell (free action, shapechange, etc.), premature destruction of the components ends the spell.
	Duration: This lists how long the magical energy of the spell lasts. Spells of instantaneous duration come and go the moment they are cast, although the results of these spells may be permanent and unchangeable by normal means. Spells of permanent duration last until the effects are negated by some means, usually by a dispel magic. Some spells have a variable duration. In most cases, the caster cannot choose the duration of spells. Spells with set durations (for example, 3 rounds/level) must be kept track of by the player. Spells of variable duration (for example, 3 + 1d4 rounds) are secretly rolled and recorded by the DM. Your DM may warn you when spell durations are approaching expiration, but there is usually no sign that a spell is going to expire; check with your DM to determine exactly how he handles this issue.
	Certain spells can be ended at will by the caster. In order to dismiss these spells, the original caster must be within range of the spell's center of effect--within the same range at which the spell can be cast. The caster also must be able to speak words of dismissal. Note that only the original caster can dismiss his spells in this way.
	Casting Time: This entry is important, if the optional casting time rules are used. If only a number is given, the casting time is added to the caster's initiative die rolls. If the spell requires a round or number of rounds to cast, it goes into effect at the end of the last round of casting time. If Delsenora casts a spell that takes one round, it goes into effect at the end of the round in which she begins casting. If the spell requires three rounds to cast, it goes into effect at the end of the third round. Spells requiring a turn or more go into effect at the end of the stated turn.
	Area of Effect: This lists the creatures, volume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can be affected by the spell. Spells with an area or volume that can be shaped by the caster will have a minimum dimension of 10 feet in any direction, unless the spell description specifically states otherwise. Thus, a cloud that has a 10-foot cube per caster level might, when cast by a 12th-level caster, have dimensions 10' × 10' × 120', 20' × 20' × 30', or any similar combination that totals twelve 10-foot cubes. Combinations such as 5' × 10' × 240' are not possible unless specifically allowed.
	Some spells (such as bless) affect the friends or enemies of the caster. In all cases, this refers to the perception of the caster at the time the spell is cast. For example, a chaotic good character allied with a lawful neutral cleric would receive the benefits of the latter's bless spell.
	Saving Throw: This lists whether the spell allows the target a saving throw and the effect of a successful save: "Neg." results in the spell having no effect; "1/2" means the character suffers half the normal amount of damage; "none" means no saving throw is allowed.
	Wisdom adjustments to saving throws apply to enchantment/charm spells.
	Solid physical barriers provide saving throw bonuses and damage reduction. Cover and concealment may affect saving throws and damage (the DM has additional information about this).
	A creature that successfully saves against a spell with no apparent physical effect (such as a charm, hold, or magic jar) may feel a definite force or tingle that is characteristic of a magical attack, if the DM desires. But the exact hostile spell effect or creature ability used cannot be deduced from this tingle.
	A being's carried equipment and possessions are assumed to make their saving throws against special attacks if the creature makes its saving throw, unless the spell specifically states otherwise. If the creature fails its saving throw, or if the attack form is particularly potent, the possessions may require saving throws using either item saving throws (see the DMG) or the being's saving throw. The DM will inform you when this happens.
	Any character can voluntarily forgo a saving throw. This allows a spell or similar attack that normally grants a saving throw to have full effect on the character. Likewise, any creature can voluntarily lower its magic resistance allowing a spell to automatically function when cast on it. Forgoing a saving throw or magic resistance roll need not always be voluntary. If a creature or character can be tricked into lowering its resistance, the spell will have full effect, even if it is not the spell the victim believed he was going to receive. The victim must consciously choose to lower his resistance; it is not sufficient that he is caught off guard. For example, a character would receive a saving throw if a magic user in the party suddenly attacked him with a fireball, even if the magic user had been friendly to that point. However, the same character would not receive a saving throw if the magic user convinced him that he was about to receive a levitation spell but cast a fireball instead. Your DM will decide when NPCs have lowered their resistances. You must tell your DM when your character is voluntarily lowering his resistance.
	Spell Description: The text provides a complete description of how the spell functions and its game effects. It covers most typical uses of the spell, if there are more than one, but cannot deal with every possible application players might find. In these cases, the spell information in the text should provide guidance on how to adjudicate the situation.
	Spells with multiple functions enable the caster to select which function he wants to use at the time of casting. Usually a single function of a multiple-function spell is weaker than a single-function spell of the same level.
	Spell effects that give bonuses or penalties to abilities, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, etc., are not usually cumulative with each other or with other magic: the strongest single effect applies. For example, a fighter drinks a potion of giant strength and then receives the 2nd-level magic user spell strength. Only the strongest magic (the potion) is effective. When the potion's duration ends, however, the strength spell is still in effect, until its duration also expires.




Chapter 8: 
Experience 

After a player's character has bravely set out and survived his first adventure, the player will have experienced the entertainment of role-playing games. But what will the character have gained? If the character never improves, he will never be able to survive, let alone overcome the powerful dangers that fill the AD&D game worlds.
		Fortunately, this isn't the case. Every time a character goes on an adventure he learns something. He may learn a little more about his physical limits, encounter a creature he has never seen before, try a spell as yet unused, or discover a new peculiarity of nature. Indeed, not all his learning experience need be positive. After blowing up half his party with a poorly placed fireball, a magic user may (though there is no guarantee) learn to pay more attention to ranges and areas of effect. After charging a basilisk, a fighter may learn that caution is a better tactic for dealing with the beast (provided the other characters can change him from stone back to flesh). Regardless of the method, the character has managed to learn something.
	Some of the information and skills learned in the game can be applied directly in play. When a magic user toasts his friends with a badly cast fireball, the player learns to pay more attention to the area of effect of a fireball. Though the player made the mistake and his character only carried out the actions, the player's friends will also learn to keep their characters well away from his.
	The reward for this type of learning is direct and immediate. The characters benefit because each of the players has a better understanding of what to do or where to go
	However, a character also improves by increasing his power. Although the player can improve his play, he cannot arbitrarily give his character more hit points, more spells, or a better chance to hit with an attack. These gains are made by earning experience points (XP).
	An experience point is a concrete measure of a character's improvement. It represents a host of abstract factors: increased confidence, physical exercise, insight, and on-the-job training. When a character earns enough experience points to advance to the next experience level, these abstract factors translate into a measurable improvement in the abilities of the character. Just what areas improve and how quickly improvement occurs all depend on the character's class.

Group Experience Awards 
Experience points are earned through the activities of the characters, which generally relate to their adventuring goals. Thus, all characters on an adventure receive some experience points for overcoming their enemies or obstacles. Since group cooperation is important, experience points for defeating foes are given to all members of the group, regardless of their actions. Who is to say that the magic user, standing ready with a spell just in case things got ugly, might not have been necessary? Or that the bard who covered the party's escape route wasn't doing something important? A character who never hefts a sword may still have good advice or important suggestions on better tactics. Furthermore, the magic user and the bard can also learn from the actions of others.

Individual Experience Awards 
Player characters also earn experience points for individual deeds, as determined by their class. Generally, each character earns points for doing actions appropriate to his group. Warriors earn additional experience points for defeating creatures. The more difficult the battle, the greater the number of experience points. Magic users earn points for using their spells for specific purposes. The magic user who walks into the woods and casts his spells for no reason doesn't gain experience points; the magic user who casts a lightning bolt at a beholder has used his spell for a purpose. He gains experience points. Magic users also earn experience points for researching new spells and creating magical items. Clerics can earn experience points for researching new spells and creating magical items. Clerics can earn experience points by spreading their beliefs and using their powers in service of their deity. Rogues, who tend to have a larcenous streak, earn experience points by using their special abilities and finding or earning gold.
	A character can also earn experience for the player's actions, such as playing the game well. When a player does a good job creating and pretending to be his character, the DM may give the character experience points for good role-playing. If the player is really involved and takes a major part in the game, the DM can give the player's character extra experience points. If the player uses his head to come up with a really good idea, the DM can give the character experience points for his contribution.
	Finally, a character can earn experience points for successfully completing an adventure or achieving a goal the DM has set. Although a player may have a pretty good idea of what his character is supposed to accomplish, he won't know if he'll be awarded experience points for it until his character actually receives them. However, there is no rule that the DM must be consistent in these awards, or even that he must give a character anything at all.

Training 
     All characters must be trained to advance in level.  The rules for this are as follows :
Members of any character class except for condottiere and monk will attain 2nd level without need of training, but thereafter must be trained in order to advance in level.  The condottiere and monk must be trained for each and every level advancement.  Costs for this will vary, but a good guideline would be a base of 7500 silver pieces multiplied by the level for which the character is training.  Weapon specialization for fighters is a base of 20000 silver pieces, and each new weapon and nonweapon proficiency, a base of 5000 silver pieces.  Other skills are too variable to present a base cost; it depends more on good role-playing, and where your character goes to be trained.

Where's the Specific Info? 
The preceding text has covered general guidelines as to how and why characters receive experience points.           I do not use any experience point calculating tables for this.  I assign experience to characters for good role-playing, applicable skills used, and strong character personalities.  Experience points are not based on what you kill, or on treasure acquired.
     Also, a point of note :  Your player character must be a worshiper of some deity of the world in order to advance past the second level of experience.  This correlates to and supports the definition of hit points described in the 1st edition Players Handbook.

Experience Point Tables for Character Classes
     The experience level advancement charts are as per the first edition Players Handbook, and are reproduced for ease of reference within each character class description.  Do not reference the second edition Players Handbook for these.





Chapter 9: 
Combat 

The AD&D game is an adventure game designed to give players a feeling of excitement and danger. Characters brave the unknown perils of moldering dungeons and thorn-covered wilderness, facing off against hideous monsters and evil villains. Thus, it is important for all players to know the basic rules for handling combat.
	To create the proper sense of danger and excitement, the rules for combat must be thorough, but they must also be playable and exciting enough to create a vivid picture in the minds of the players. Combat in the AD&D game has to allow many different actions and outcomes--as many as the imagination can produce. Knowing that anything could happen next (because the rules allow it) creates excitement for everyone.

More Than Just Hack-and-Slash 
	As important as fighting is to the AD&D game, it isn't the be-all and end-all of play. It's just one way for characters to deal with situations. If characters could do nothing but fight, the game would quickly get boring--every encounter would be the same. Because there is more to the game than fighting, we'll cover much more than simple hack-and-slash combat in this chapter.
	In addition to explaining the basic mechanics of hitting and missing, there are rules here for turning undead, special ways to attack and defend, poison, heroic feats, and more.

Definitions 
Many game terms are used throughout the combat rules. To understand the rules, players must understand these terms, so brief explanations appear below. Further details are provided throughout this chapter.
	Armor Class (AC) is the protective rating of a type of armor. In some circumstances, AC is modified by the amount of protection gained or lost because of the character's situation. For instance, crouching behind a boulder improves a character's Armor Class, while being attacked from behind worsens his AC.
	Armor provides protection by reducing the chance that a character is attacked successfully (and suffers damage). Armor does not absorb damage, it prevents it. A fighter in full plate mail may be a slow-moving target, but penetrating his armor to cause any damage is no small task.
	Armor Class is measured on a scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the best (very powerful magical armors). The lower the number, the more effective the armor. Shields can also improve the AC of a character (see "Shields" in Chapter 6: Money and Equipment).
	Abilities and situations can also affect a character's Armor Class. High Dexterity gives a bonus to Armor Class, for example. But even a character with a Dexterity bonus can have this bonus negated if he is attacked from the rear.
	Damage is what happens to a character when an opponent attacks him successfully. Damage can also occur as a result of poison, fire, falling, acid, and anything even remotely dangerous in the real world. Damage from most attacks is measured in hit points. Each time a character is hit, he suffers points of damage. It could be as little as 1 point to as many as 80 or more. These points are subtracted from the character's current hit point total. When this reaches 0, the character is dead.
	Initiative determines the order in which things happen in a combat round. Like so many things in the world, initiative is determined by a combination of ability, situation, and chance.
	At the start of each round of a battle, an initiative roll is made by both sides. This roll can be modified by the abilities of the combatants and by the situation. The person or side with the lower modified die roll acts first.
	Melee is any situation in which characters are battling each other hand-to-hand, whether with fists, teeth, claws, swords, axes, pikes, or something else. Strength and Dexterity are valuable assets in melee.
	Missile combat is defined as any time a weapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or otherwise propelled. Missile and melee combat have the same basic rules, but there are special situations and modifiers that apply only to missile combat.
	Saving throws are measures of a character's resistance to special types of attacks--poisons, magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or mind of the character. The ability to make successful saving throws improves as the character increases in level; Dexterity and general mental fortitude aid in honing combat senses. Experience makes saving throws easier.
	Surprise can happen any time characters meet another group unexpectedly (monsters, evil knights, peasants, etc.). Surprise is simply what happens when one side--a person or party--is taken unawares, unable to react until they gather their wits. Their opponents, if unsurprised, are allowed a bonus round of action while the surprised characters recover. It's entirely possible for both sides in a given situation to be surprised!
	Attacking with surprise gives bonuses to the attack roll (see Table 51). A surprised character also has a decreased chance of rolling a successful saving throw, if one is needed.
	Surprise is determined by a die roll and is normally checked at the beginning of an encounter. Surprise is very unpredictable, so there are very few modifiers to the roll.
	THAC0 is an acronym for "To Hit Armor Class 0." This is the number a character, NPC, or monster needs to attack an Armor Class 0 target successfully. THAC0 depends on a character's group and level (see Table 53). The THAC0 number can be used to calculate the number needed to hit any Armor Class. THAC0 is refigured each time a character increases in level. Using THAC0 speeds the play of combat greatly.

The Attack Roll 
At the heart of the combat system is the attack roll. This is the die roll that determines whether an attack succeeds or fails. The number a player needs in order to make a successful attack roll is also called the "to-hit" number.
	Attack rolls are used for attacks with swords, bows, rocks, and other weapons, as well as blows from fists, tackling, and other hand-to-hand attacks. Attack rolls are also used to resolve a variety of potentially injury-causing actions that require accuracy (for example, throwing a rock at a small target or tossing a sword to a party member in the middle of a fight).

Critical hits and fumbles
     The system for these is as follows : On a roll of a 1 on the d20, the character loses grip on a weapon with one hand, or stumbles if a weapon is not held.  This results in the character losing combat action the next round.  On a roll of a natural 20, and the character needs a modified 15 or less "to hit", the weapon used by the character inflicts its maximum damage

Figuring the To-Hit Number 
     A note about "THAC0" :  I do not use any of the combat charts found in any of the AD&D hardcover texts, so don't even try to figure out a THAC0 for your character.  I will take care of cross-referencing your attack roll on the chart to determine if your character inflicts damage to his or her opponent.
     "to hit" rolls - when you make an attack roll, tell me the number you rolled, then all combined modifiers.
Ex. : a 14 is rolled, and the character has modifiers of +1, +3, and -2.  It would be expressed as : "14, +2".
     damage rolls - when you roll damage against an NPC opponent ( like monsters and the like ), add all your character's modifiers to your die roll then tell me the end result.
Ex. : a 6 is rolled, and the character has modifiers of +2, +3, and -1. It would be expressed as : "10".

Modifiers to the Attack Roll 
	In combat, many factors can modify the number a character needs for a successful hit. These variables are reflected in modifiers to the to-hit number or to the attack roll.
	Strength Modifiers: A character's Strength can modify the die roll, altering both the chance to hit and the damage caused. This modifier is always applied to melees and attacks with hurled missile weapons (a spear or an axe).
	A positive Strength modifier can be applied to bows if the character has a special bow made for him, designed to take advantage of his high Strength. Characters with Strength penalties always suffer them when using a bow weapon. They simply are not able to draw back the bowstring far enough. Characters never have Strength modifiers when using crossbows--the power of the shot is imparted by a machine, not the player character.
	Magical items: The magical properties of a weapon can also modify combat. Items that impart a bonus to the attack roll or Armor Class are identified by a plus sign. For example, a sword +1 improves a character's chance to hit by one. A suit of chain mail +1 improves the Armor Class of the character by one (which means you subtract one from the character's AC, changing an AC of 5 to an AC of 4, for example). Cursed items have a negative modifier (a penalty), resulting in a subtraction from the attack roll or an addition to Armor Class.  There is no limit to the number of modifiers that can be applied to a single die roll. Nor is there a limit to the positive or negative number (the total of all modifiers) that can be applied to a die roll.
The table below lists some standard combat modifiers. Positive numbers are bonuses for the attacker; negative numbers are penalties.

Combat Modifiers

						Attack Roll
Situation			Modifier
Attacker on higher ground	   +1
Defender invisible	   -4
Defender off-balance	   +2
Defender sleeping or held	Automatic*
Defender stunned or prone	   +4
Defender surprised	   +1
Missile fire, long range	   -5
Missile fire, medium range	   -2
Rear attack	   +2
	*If the defender is attacked during the course of a normal melee, the attack automatically hits and causes normal damage. If no other fighting is going on (i.e., all others have been slain or driven off), the defender can be slain automatically.

Combat and Encounters 
Encounters are the heart of the AD&D game. Since encounters with monsters and NPCs often lead to combat, an understanding of what happens during battles is vital for everyone. There are several factors the DM will consider in any combat, most of which arise from the circumstances of the encounter. Is anyone surprised? How far apart are the opponents? How many of them are there? Answers to these questions are found in the Encounter section of the DMG. These are questions common to all encounters, whether combat occurs or not.

The Combat Round 
If an encounter escalates into a combat situation, the time scale of the game automatically goes to rounds (also called melee rounds or combat rounds). Rounds are used to measure the actions of characters in combat (or other intensive actions in which time is important).  A round is approximately one minute long. Ten combat rounds equal a turn (or, put another way, a turn equals 10 minutes of game time). This is particularly important to remember for spells that last for turns, rather than rounds.  But these are just approximations--precise time measurements are impossible to make in combat. An action that might be ridiculously easy under normal circumstances could become an undertaking of truly heroic scale when attempted in the middle of a furious, chaotic battle.  Imagine the simple act of imbibing a healing potion. First, a character decides to drink the potion before retiring for the night. All he has to do is get it out of his backpack, uncork it, and drink the contents. No problem.
	Now imagine the same thing in the middle of a fight. The potion is safely stowed in the character's backpack. First, he takes stock of the situation to see if anyone else can get the potion out for him, but, not surprisingly, everyone is rather busy. So, sword in one hand, he shrugs one strap of the pack off his shoulder. Then, just as two orcs leap toward him, the other strap threatens to slip down, entangling his sword arm. Already the loose strap keeps him from fully using his shield.  Holding the shield as best as possible in front of him, he scrambles backward to avoid the monsters' first wild swings. He gets pushed back a few more feet when a companion shoulders past to block their advance. His companion bought him a little time, so he kneels, lays down his sword, and slips the backpack all the way off. Hearing a wild cry, he instinctively swings his shield up just in time to ward off a glancing blow.  Rummaging through the pack, he finally finds the potion, pulls it out, and, huddling behind his shield, works the cork free. Just then there is a flash of flame all around him--a fireball! He grits his teeth against the heat, shock, and pain and tries to remember not to crush or spill the potion vial. Biting back the pain of the flames, he is relieved to see the potion is still intact.  Quickly, he gulps it down, reclaims his sword, kicks his backpack out of the way, and runs back up to the front line. In game terms, the character withdrew, was missed by one attacker, made a successful saving throw vs. spell (from the fireball), drank a potion, and was ready for combat the next round.

What You Can Do in One Round 
	Whatever the precise length of a combat round, a character can accomplish only one basic action in that round, be it making an attack, casting a spell, drinking a potion, or tending to a fallen comrade. The basic action, however, may involve several lesser actions.
	When making an attack, a character is likely to close with his opponent, circle for an opening, feint here, jab there, block a thrust, leap back, and perhaps finally make a telling blow. A spellcaster may fumble for his components, dodge an attacker, mentally review the steps of the spell, intone the spell, and then move to safety when it is all done. It has already been shown what drinking a potion might entail. All of these things might happen in a bit less than a minute or a bit more, but the standard is one minute and one action to the round.
	Some examples of the actions a character can accomplish include the following:
 Make an attack (make attack rolls up to the maximum number allowed the character class at a given level)
 	 Cast one spell (if the casting time is one round or less)
 	 Drink a potion
 	 Light a torch
 	 Use a magical item
 	 Move to the limit of his movement rate
 	 Attempt to open a stuck or secret door
 	 Bind a character's wounds
 	 Search a body
 	 Hammer in a spike
 	 Recover a dropped weapon

	There are also actions that take a negligible amount of time, things the character does without affecting his ability to perform a more important task. Examples of these include the following:
  Shout warnings, brief instructions, or demands for surrender, but not conversations where a reply is expected.
  Change weapons by dropping one and drawing another.
  Drop excess equipment, such as backpacks, lanterns, or torches.

Initiative 
	The initiative roll determines who acts first in any given combat round. Initiative is not set, but changes from round to round (combat being an uncertain thing, at best). A character never knows for certain if he will get to act before another.
	Initiative is normally determined with a single roll for each side in a conflict. This tells whether all the members of the group get to act before or after those of the other side(s).
	There are also two optional methods that can be used to determine initiative. Each of these optional methods breaks the group action down into more individual initiatives. However, the general method of determining initiative remains the same in all cases.

Standard Initiative Procedure 
      Initiative is rolled on a d10, one roll for each side in combat; low number goes first.  The DM will tell you if the individual situation differs, otherwise, this is standard procedure.  Normally, this means the DM rolls for the monsters (or NPCs), while one of the players rolls for the PC party. Low roll wins initiative. If more than two sides are involved in combat, the remaining sides act in ascending order of initiative.
	If both (or all) sides roll the same number for initiative, everything happens simultaneously--all attack rolls, damage, spells, and other actions are completed before any results are applied. It is possible for a magic user to be slain by goblins who collapse from his sleep spell at the end of the round.
Initiative Modifiers 
	Situational factors can affect who has initiative. To reflect this, modifiers are added to or subtracted from the initiative die roll.

Standard Modifiers to Initiative

Specific Situation			      Modifier
Hasted	-2
Slowed	+2
On higher ground	-1
Set to receive a charge	-2
Wading or slippery footing	+2
Wading in deep water	+4
Foreign environment*	+6
Hindered (tangled, climbing, held)	+3
Waiting (see p. 112)	+1

	*This applies to situations in which the party is in a completely different environment (swimming underwater without the aid of a ring of free action, for example).
	Everyone in the party who will be involved in the round's action must qualify for the modifier. For example, all members of a party must be on higher ground than the opposition in order to get the higher ground modifier. The DM will probably ask each player where his character is standing in order to clarify this.
	The side with the lowest modified roll on 1d10 has the initiative and acts first.

Optional Modifiers to Initiative

Specific Situation				Modifier
Attacking with weapon	Weapon speed
Breath weapon	  +1
Casting a spell	Casting time
Creature size (Monsters attacking
with natural weapons only)*
   Tiny	    0
   Small	  +3
   Medium	  +3
   Large	  +6
   Huge	  +9
   Gargantuan	  +12
Innate spell ability	  +3
Magical Items**
Miscellaneous Magic	  +3
   Potion	  +4
   Ring	  +3
   Rods	  +1
   Scroll	Casting time of spell
   Stave	  +2
   Wand	  +3
	*This applies only to creatures fighting with natural weapons--claws, bites, etc. Creatures using weaponry use the speed factor of the weapon, regardless of the creature's size.
	**Use the initiative modifier listed unless the item description says otherwise.



Spellcasting and Initiative 
	Casting times for spells can modify initiative rolls, creating a realistic delay for the spellcaster. When a spell's "Casting Time" parameter is given as a number without any units (for example, rounds or turns), then that number is added to the caster's initiative roll to determine his modified initiative. When a spell requires a round or more to cast, a normal initiative roll is not made--a spell requiring one round to cast takes effect at the end of the current round, after all other actions are completed.
	Spells that require more than one round to cast involve some bookkeeping. The DM or one of the players must keep track of the rounds spent in casting. If the spellcasting character is disturbed during this time, the spell is lost. If all goes well, the spell takes effect at the very end of the last round of the required casting time. Thus, a spell requiring 10 minutes to cast would require 10 combat rounds, and wouldn't take effect until the very end of the 10th round.

Attacking with Two Weapons 
A tricky fighting style available only to warriors and rogues is that of fighting with two weapons simultaneously. The character chooses not to use a shield in favor of another weapon, granting him a greater number of attacks, with a penalty to his attack rolls (rangers are exempt from the attack roll penalty).
	When using a second weapon in his off-hand, a character is limited in his weapon choice. His principal weapon can be whatever he chooses, provided it can be wielded with one hand. The second weapon must be smaller in size and weight than the character's main weapon (though a dagger can always be used as a second weapon, even if the primary weapon is also a dagger). A fighter can use a long sword and a short sword, or a long sword and a dagger, but he cannot use two long swords. Nor can the character use a shield, unless it is kept strapped onto his back.
	When attacking, all characters but rangers suffer penalties to their attack rolls. Attacks made with the main weapon suffer a -2 penalty, and attacks made with the second weapon suffer a -4 penalty. The character's Reaction Adjustment (based on his Dexterity, see Table 2) modifies this penalty. A low Dexterity score will worsen the character's chance to hit with each attack. A high Dexterity can negate this particular penalty, although it cannot result in a positive modifier on the attack rolls for either weapon (i.e., the Reaction Adjustment can, at best, raise the attack roll penalties to 0).
	The use of two weapons enables the character to make one additional attack each combat round, with the second weapon. The character gains only one additional attack each round, regardless of the number of attacks he may normally be allowed. Thus, a warrior able to attack 3/2 (once in the first round and twice in the second) can attack 5/2 (twice in the first round and three times in the second).

Movement in Combat 
Since a round is roughly a minute long, it should be easy for a character to move just about anywhere he wants during the course of the round. After all, Olympic-class sprinters can cover vast amounts of ground in a minute.
	However, a character in an AD&D game is  not an Olympic sprinter running in a straight line. He is trying to maneuver through a battle without getting killed. He is keeping his eyes open for trouble, avoiding surprise, watching his back, watching the backs of his partners, and looking for a good opening, while simultaneously planning his next move, sometimes through a haze of pain. He may be carrying a load of equipment that slows him down significantly. Because of all these things, the distance a character can move is significantly less than players generally think.
	In a combat round, a being can move up to 10 times its movement rating (see Chapter 14: Time and Movement) in feet. Thus, if a character has a movement rating of 9, he can move up to 90 feet in a round. However, the types of moves a character can make during combat are somewhat limited.

Movement in Melee 
	The basic move is to get closer for combat--i.e., move close enough to an enemy to attack. This is neither a blind rush nor a casual stroll. Instead, the character approaches quickly but with caution. When closing for combat, a character can move up to half his allowed distance and still make a melee attack.



Movement and Missile Combat 
	Rather than slug it out toe to toe with an opponent, a character can move up to one-half his normal movement rate and engage in missile fire at half his normal rate of fire. Thus, a man capable of moving 120 feet and armed with a long bow (two shots per round, under normal circumstances) could move 60 feet and still fire one shot. The same man, armed with a heavy crossbow (one shot every other round) would be able to shoot only once every four rounds while on the move.

Charging an Opponent 
	A character can also charge a foe. A charge increases the character's movement rate by 50% and enables the character to make an attack at the end of his movement. A charging character also gains a +2 bonus to his attack roll, mainly from momentum. Certain weapons (such as a lance) inflict double the rolled damage in a charge.
	However, charging gives the opponents several advantages. First, they gain a -2 bonus to their initiative rolls. Second, charging characters gain no Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class and they suffer an AC penalty of 1. Finally, if the defender is using a spear or polearm weapon and sets it against the charge (bracing the butt against a stone or his foot), he inflicts double damage on a successful hit.

Retreat 
	To get out of a combat, characters can make a careful withdrawal or they can simply flee.
	Withdrawing: When making a withdrawal, a character carefully backs away from his opponent (who can choose to follow). The character moves up to 1/3 his normal movement rate.
	If two characters are fighting a single opponent and one of them decides to withdraw, the remaining character can block the advance of the opponent. This is a useful method for getting a seriously injured man out of a combat.
	Fleeing: To flee from combat, a character simply turns and runs up to his full movement rate. However, the fleeing character drops his defenses and turns his back to his opponent.
	The enemy is allowed a free attack (or multiple attacks if the creature has several attacks per round) at the rear of the fleeing character. This attack is made the instant the character flees: It doesn't count against the number of attacks that opponent is allowed during the round, and initiative is irrelevant.
	The fleeing character can be pursued, unless a companion blocks the advance of the enemy.

Attacking Without Killing 
There are times when a character wants to defeat another being without killing it. A companion may have been charmed into attacking his friends (and his friends don't want to kill him to save themselves!); an enemy may have information the PCs can get only by subduing him; characters may simply see the monetary value of bringing back a real, live monster. Whatever the case, sooner or later characters are going to try.
     Nonlethal combat is a very flexible and variable thing.  There are no tables, charts, etc. used for this; your DM will guide all instances of nonlethal combat.

Weapons In Nonlethal Combat 
	As you might expect, weapons have their place in nonlethal combat, whether a character is defending or pressing the attack.
	Weapons in Defense: A character attempting to punch, wrestle, or overbear an armed opponent can do so only by placing himself at great risk. Making matters worse, an armed defender is automatically allowed to strike with his weapon before the unarmed attack is made, regardless of the initiative die roll. Furthermore, since his opponent must get very close, the defender gains a +4 bonus to his attack and damage rolls. If the attacker survives, he can then attempt his attack.
	Those involved in a wrestling bout are limited to weapons of small size after the first round of combat--it's very difficult to use a sword against someone who is twisting your sword arm or clinging to your back, trying to break your neck. For this reason, nearly all characters will want to carry a dagger or knife.
	Nonlethal Weapon Attacks: It is possible to make an armed attack without causing serious damage (striking with the flat of the blade, for example). This is not as easy as it sounds, however.

Nonlethal Combat and Creatures 
	When dealing with nonhumanoid opponents, a number of factors must be considered.
	First, unintelligent creatures, as a rule, never try to grapple, punch, or pull down an opponent. They cheerfully settle for tearing him apart, limb by limb. This, to their small and animalistic minds, is a better solution.
	Second, the natural weapon of a creature are always usable. Unlike men with swords, a lion or a carnivorous ape doesn't lose the use of its teeth and fangs just because a character is very close to it.
	Finally, and of greatest importance, creatures tend to be better natural fighters than humans. All attacks for a tiger are the same as punching or wrestling. It's just that the tiger has claws! Furthermore, a tiger can use all of its legs effectively--front and back.

Touch Spells and Combat 
Many spells used by clerics and magic users take effect only when the target is touched by the caster. Under normal circumstances, this is no problem--the spellcaster reaches out and touches the recipient. However, if the target is unwilling, or the spell is used in the midst of a general melee, the situation is much different.
	Unwilling Targets: The spellcaster must make a successful attack roll for the spell to have any effect. The magic user or cleric calculates his to-hit number normally, according to the intended victim's Armor Class and other protections. The DM can modify the roll if the victim is unprepared for or unaware of the attack. If the roll succeeds, the spellcaster touches the target and the normal spell effect occurs.
	Willing Targets: When attempting to cast a spell on a willing target, the casting is automatic as long as both characters are not engaged in combat. For example, if a fighter withdraws from melee, a cleric could heal him the next round.
	If the recipient of the spell attempts to do anything besides waiting for the spell to take effect, an attack roll against AC 10 must be made. However, no AC modifiers for Dexterity are applied, since the target is not trying to avoid the spell!
	Whenever a touch spell is successful, the spellcaster suffers from any special defenses of his target, if they are continually in operation. A successful touch to a vampire would not result in energy drain, since the power only works when the vampire wills it, but touching a fire elemental would result in serious burns.
	When a touch spell is cast, it normally remains effective only for that round. However, certain spells do specify special conditions or durations. Be sure to check each spell description carefully.

Missile Weapons in Combat 
	In general, missile combat is handled identically to standard melee. Intentions are announced, initiative is rolled, and attack rolls are made. However, there are some special rules and situations that apply only to missile combat.
	Missile weapons are divided into two general categories. The first includes all standard, direct-fire, single-target missiles--slings, arrows, quarrels, spears, throwing axes, and the like.
	The second category includes all grenade-like missiles that have an area effect, no matter how small. Thus, an attack with these weapons does not have to hit its target directly to have a chance of affecting it. Included in this group are small flasks of oil, acid, poison, holy water, potions, and boulders. Hurled boulders are included because they bounce and bound along after they hit, leaving a swath of destruction.

Range 
	The first step in making a missile attack is to find the range from the attacker to the target. This is measured in yards from one point to the other. This distance is compared to the range categories for the weapon used.
	If the distance is greater than the long range given, the target is out of range; if the distance is between the long- and medium-range numbers, the target is at long range; when between the medium- and short-range numbers, medium range is used; when equal to or less than the short-range distance, the target is at short range.
	Short-range attacks suffer no range modifier. Medium-range attacks suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll. Long-range attacks suffer a -5 penalty. Some weapons have no short range since they must arc a certain distance before reaching their target. These attacks are always made with an attack roll penalty.



Rate of Fire 
	Bows, crossbows, and many other missile weapons have different rates of fire (ROF)--the number of missiles they can shoot in a single round.
	Small, light weapons can be thrown very quickly, so up to three darts can be thrown in a single round. Arrows can be nocked and let loose almost as quickly, so up to two shots can be fired in a single round.
	Some weapons (such as heavy crossbows) take a long time to load and can be fired only every other round.
	Whatever the ROF, multiple missile shots are handled the same way as other multiple attacks for the purposes of determining initiative. The ROF of each missile weapon is listed in table 45 in Chapter 6.

Ability Modifiers in Missile Combat 
	Attack roll and damage modifiers for Strength are always used when an attack is made with a hurled weapon. Here the power of the character's arm is a significant factor in the effectiveness of the attack.
	When using a bow, the attack roll and damage Strength modifiers apply only if the character has a properly prepared bow (see Chapter 6: Money and Equipment). Characters never receive Strength bonuses when using crossbows or similar mechanical devices.
	Dexterity modifiers to the attack roll are applied when making a missile attack with a hand-held weapon. Thus, a character adds his Dexterity modifier when using a bow, crossbow, or axe but not when firing a trebuchet or other siege engine.

Shot in the Dark
     Missile fire in the dark is next to impossible unless the attacker has a light source so he or she can see both the opponent and the weapon being fired or thrown.  You can try to shoot in the dark if you want, but don't expect to hit very much.
Firing into a Melee 
	Missile weapons are intended mainly as long-range weapons. Ideally, they are used before the opponents reach your line. However, ideal situations are all too rare, and characters often discover that the only effective way to attack is to shoot arrows (or whatever) at an enemy already in melee combat with their companions. While possible, and certainly allowed, this is a risky proposition.
	When missiles are fired into a melee, the DM counts the number of figures in the immediate area of the intended target. Each Medium figure counts as 1. Small (S) figures count as 1/2, Large as 2, Huge as 4, and Gargantuan as 6. The total value is compared to the value of each character or creature in the target melee. Using this ratio, the DM rolls a die to determine who (or what) will be the target of the shot.

Taking Cover Against Missile Fire 
	One of the best ways to avoid being hit and injured is to hide behind something--a wall, a tree, a building corner, a heap of boulders, or whatever happens to be available. Professional adventurers, wishing to make this sound heroic, call this taking cover.
	Taking cover doesn't work particularly well in a melee, since the cover hampers defender and attacker equally. However, it is quite an effective tactic against missile fire.
	There are two types of protection a character can have. The first is concealment, also called soft cover. A character hiding behind a clump of bushes is concealed. He can be seen, but only with difficulty, and it's no easy task to determine exactly where he is. The bushes cannot stop an arrow, but they do make it less likely that the character is hit. Other types of concealment include curtains, tapestries, smoke, fog, and brambles.
	The other type of protection is cover, sometimes called, more precisely, hard cover. It is, as its name implies, something a character can hide behind that will block a missile. Hard cover includes stone walls, the corner of a building, tables, doors, earth embankments, tree trunks, and magical walls of force.
	Cover helps a potential target by giving the attacker a negative modifier to his attack roll. The exact modifier for concealment or cover depends on the degree to which it is being used as shelter. A character who stands behind a two-foot wall is a pretty obvious target, especially when compared to the character who lies down behind that wall and carefully peers over it.

 
Cover and Concealment Modifiers

Target is:	Cover	Concealment
25% hidden	  -2	-1
50% hidden	  -4	-2
75% hidden	  -7	-3
90% hidden	-10	-4


	Cover also has an affect on saving throws, granting the character the modifier listed on Table 59 as a bonus to his saving throws against spells that cause physical damage (for example, fireball, lightning bolt, etc.)
	Furthermore, a character who has 90% cover (or more) suffers one-half normal damage on a failed save and no damage at all if a saving throw is successful. This assumes, of course, that the fireball, lightning bolt, or whatever, hit the cover--a man crouching behind a stone wall would be protected if a fireball exploded in front of the wall, but would not be protected by cover if the blast occurred behind him, on his side of the wall.

Grenade-Like Missiles 
	Unlike standard missiles, which target a specific creature, a grenade-like missile is aimed at a point, whether this point is a creature or a spot on the ground. When the attack is announced, the player indicates where he wants the missile to land. This then becomes the target point and is used to determine the direction and distance of any scatter.
	Most grenade-like missiles are items of opportunity or necessity--rocks, flasks of oil, vials of holy water, or beakers of acid. As such, these items are not listed on the equipment tables for range, ROF, and damage. The range each can be thrown varies with the Strength of the character and the weight of the object.
	A missile of five pounds or less can be thrown about 30 feet. Short range is 10 feet, medium range is 20 feet, and everything beyond is maximum range. Heavier items have reduced ranges. Just how far an object can be thrown is decided by the DM.
	Exceptionally heavy items can be thrown only if the character rolls a successful bend bars/lift gates check. In no case can a character throw an item heavier than his Strength would allow him to lift. Thus, the DM can rule that a character would have little trouble chucking a half-empty backpack across a ten-foot chasm, but the character would need to make a check in order to heave an orc ten feet through the air into the faces of his orcish friends.
	Once a container hits, it normally breaks immediately. However, this is not always true. Some missiles, like soft leather flasks or hard pottery, are particularly resistant. If there's some doubt about whether or not a thrown object will break, the DM can require an item saving throw (this information is in the DMG) to see if it shatters or rips, spewing its contents everywhere.
	The DMG contains information on how to resolve the inevitable situations in which grenade-like missiles miss their targets.

Types of Grenade-Like Missiles 
	Acid damage is particularly grim. Aside from the possibility of scarring (which is left to the DM), acid damage cannot be healed by regeneration. It must be healed normally. Thus, it is very useful against regenerating creatures such as trolls. Acid is very rare.
	Holy Water affects most forms of undead and creatures from the Lower Planes. It has no effect against a creature in gaseous form or undead without material form.
	Unholy water (essentially holy water used by evil clerics) affects paladins, creatures whose purpose is to defend good (lammasu, shedu, etc.), and creatures and beings from the Upper Planes.
	Holy (or unholy) water affects creatures as does acid, causing damage that cannot be regenerated but must be healed normally.
	Oil causes damage only when it is lit. This normally requires a two-step process--first soaking the target in flammable oil and then setting it afire. Thus, using flaming oil often requires two successful attacks.
	A direct hit from flaming oil burns for two rounds, causing 1d8 points of damage in the first round and 1d8 points in the second round.
	Poison is generally not very effective as a missile weapon. Most poisons take effect only if the missile scores a direct hit, and even then only if it drops into the gaping maw of some huge creature. Contact poisons have normal poison effects on a direct hit. The DM has information about specific poison effects in the DMG.

Special Defenses 
So far, the bulk of this chapter has dealt with ways to attack. Now, it's time to turn to defense. There are several ways to avoid taking damage. Two of the most common are the saving throw and magic resistance. Somewhat less common, because its use is limited to clerics and paladins, is the ability to turn undead.

Parrying
	During a one-minute combat round, each character is assumed to block many attempted attacks and see many of his own attacks blocked. In normal combat, characters parry all the time--there's no need to single out each parry.  When a character deliberately chooses not to parry (a magic user casting a spell, for instance), his chance of being hit increases. Thus, choosing to parry, in and of itself, is not a separate option under the AD&D game rules.
	At the same time, the assumption is that characters in combat are constantly exposing themselves to some risk--trying to get a clear view of a target or looking for the opening to make an attack. There are times, however, when this is not the case. Sometimes, the only thing a character wants to do is avoid being hit.
	In order to make himself harder to hit, a character can parry--forfeit all actions for the round--he can't attack, move, or cast spells. This frees the character to concentrate solely on defense. At this point, all characters but warriors gain an AC bonus equal to half their level. A 6th-level magic user would have a +3 bonus to his AC (lowering his AC by 3). A warrior gets a bonus equal to half his level plus one. A 6th-level fighter would gain a +4 AC bonus.
	Note that the benefit is not a perfect all-around defense, and it's not effective against rear or missile attacks. It applies only to those characters attacking the defender with frontal melee attacks. This optional defense has no effect against magical attacks, so it wouldn't do anything to protect a character from the force of a lightning bolt or fireball, for example.

The Saving Throw 
The saving throw is a die roll that gives a chance, however slim, that the character or creature finds some way to save himself from certain destruction (or at least lessen the damage of a successful attack).
	More often than not, the saving throw represents an instinctive act on the part of the character--diving to the ground just as a fireball scorches the group, blanking the mind just as a mental battle begins, blocking the worst of an acid spray with a shield. The exact action is not important--DMs and players can think of lively and colorful explanations of why a saving throw succeeded or failed. Explanations tailored to the events of the moment enhance the excitement of the game.

Rolling Saving Throws 
	To make a saving throw, a player rolls a 20-sided die (1d20). The result must be equal to or greater than the character's saving throw number. The number a character needs to roll varies depending upon the character's group, his level, and what the character is trying to save himself from. A character's saving throw numbers can be found in the Saving Throw Table, below.
	Saving throws are made in a variety of situations: For attacks involving paralyzation, poison, or death magic; petrification or polymorph; rod, staff, or wand; breath weapon; and spells. The type of saving throw a character must roll is determined by the specific spell, monster, magical item, or situation involved.

Saving throws for multiclassed characters
      Multiclassed characters save as the class in which they have the highest ability scores relevant to the class.  If the primary scores are identical, then secondary scores are compared.  Clerics use wisdom and charisma, fighters use strength and constitution, magic users use intelligence and wisdom, thieves use dexterity and charisma.  


Saving Throw Priority 
	Sometimes the type of saving throw required by a situation or item isn't clear, or more than one category of saving throw may seem appropriate. For this reason, the saving throw categories in Table 60 are listed in order of importance, beginning with paralyzation, poison, and death magic, and ending with spells.
	Imagine that Rath is struck by the ray from a wand of polymorphing. Both a saving throw vs. wands and a saving throw vs. polymorph would be appropriate. But Rath must roll a saving throw vs. wands because that category has a higher priority than polymorph.
	The categories of saving throws are as follows:
	Save vs. Paralyzation, Poison, and Death Magic: This is used whenever a character is affected by a paralyzing attack (regardless of source), poison (of any strength), or certain spells and magical items that otherwise kill the character outright (as listed in their descriptions). This saving throw can also be used in situations in which exceptional force of will or physical fortitude are needed.
	Save vs. Rod, Staff, or Wand: As its name implies, this is used whenever a character is affected by the powers of a rod, staff, or wand, provided another save of higher priority isn't called for. This saving throw is sometimes specified for situations in which a character faces a magical attack from an unusual source.
	Save vs. Petrification or Polymorph: This is used any time a character is turned to stone (petrified) or polymorphed by a monster, spell, or magical item (other than a wand). It can also be used when the character must withstand some massive physical alteration of his entire body.
	Save vs. Breath Weapon: A character uses this save when facing monsters with breath weapons, particularly the powerful blast of a dragon. This save can also be used in situations where a combination of physical stamina and Dexterity are critical factors in survival.
	Save vs. Spell: This is used whenever a character attempts to resist the effects of a magical attack, either by a spellcaster or from a magical item, provided no other type of saving throw is specified. This save can also be used to resist an attack that defies any other classification.

Voluntarily Failing Saving Throws 
	No save is made if the target voluntarily chooses not to resist the effect of a spell or special attack. This is the case even if the character was duped as to the exact nature of the spell. When a character announces that he is not resisting the spell's power, that spell (or whatever) has its full effect.
	The intention not to resist must be clearly stated or set up through trickery, however. If a character is attacked by surprise or caught unawares, he is normally allowed a saving throw. The DM can modify this saving throw, making the chance of success worse, if the situation warrants it. Only in extreme cases of trickery and deception should an unwitting character be denied a saving throw.

Ability Checks as Saving Throws 
	When a character attempts to avoid danger through the use of one of his abilities, an ability check can be used in lieu of a saving throw.
	For example, Ragnar the thief has broken into someone's home when he hears a grating noise from the ceiling above him. He looks up to find a five-ton block of the ceiling headed straight for him! He is going to need speedy reactions to get out of the way, so a Dexterity ability check should be rolled to see if he avoids the trap.

Modifying Saving Throws 
	Saving throws can be modified by magical items, specific rules, and special situations. These modifiers can increase or decrease the chance of a successful saving throw.
	Modifiers that increase the chance are given as a number preceded by a plus sign. Modifiers that make success more difficult are given as a number preceded by a minus sign (-1, -2, etc.).
	Saving throw modifiers affect a character's die roll, not the saving throw number needed. Thus, if Delsenora needed an 11 for a successful saving throw vs. petrification and had a +1 bonus to her save, she would still need to roll an 11 or higher after all adjustments were made (but the +1 bonus would be added to her die roll, so that effectively she needs to roll only a 10 on the die to reach her saving throw number of 11).


	High ability scores in Dexterity and Wisdom sometimes give saving throw bonuses. A high Wisdom protects against illusions, charms, and other mental attacks. Dexterity, if high enough, can give a character a slightly higher chance of avoiding the effects of fireballs, lightning bolts, crushing boulders, and other attacks where nimbleness may be a help.
	Magical items like cloaks and rings of protection give bonuses to a character's saving throw (these are listed in the item descriptions in the DMG).
	Magical armor allows a saving throw bonus only when the save is made necessary by something physical, whether normal or magical; magical armor never gives a saving throw bonus against gas (which it cannot block), poison (which operates internally), and spells that are mental in nature or that cause no physical damage.
	Specific spells and magical items have effects, both good and ill, on a character's saving throws. Often, spells force the victim to save with a penalty, which makes even the most innocuous spell quite dangerous. (Specific information can be found in the spell descriptions, for spells, or in the DMG's Magical Items section, for magical items.)
	Minor poisons of verminous creatures such as giant centipedes, while dangerous, are weak and unlikely to bring about death in a healthy man. To recreate this effect in the game, a saving throw bonus is allowed for anyone affected by these poisons. The DM has this information.
	Unpredictable situations are sure to crop up. When this happens, the DM must determine whether saving throw modifiers are appropriate. As a guideline, modifiers for situations should range from -4 to +4. An evil cleric attacked in his shrine could very well have a +3 bonus to all his saving throws and a -3 penalty applied to those of his enemies. The powerful evil of the place could warrant the modifier.

Magic Resistance 
Some creatures or items strongly resist the effects of magic (or impart such resistance to others). This makes them more difficult to affect with magical energy than ordinary creatures or items.
	A rare few creatures are extremely anti-magical--magic rolls off them like water off a duck's back. More common are creatures, especially from the Outer Planes of existence, that live in enchanted or sorcerous lands and are filled with powerful magical energies. These creatures eat and breathe the vapors of magic userry, and they have a high tolerance against arcane power.
	Magic resistance is an innate ability--that is, the possessor does not have to do anything special to use it. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for his magic resistance to operate. Such resistance is part of the creature or item and cannot be separated from it. (Creatures, however, can voluntarily lower their magic resistance at will.)
	Magic resistance is also an individual ability. A creature with magic resistance cannot impart this power to others by holding their hands or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and magical items have the ability to bestow magic resistance upon another.
	Magic resistance is given as a percentile number. For a magical effect to have any chance of success, the magic resistance must be overcome. The target (the one with the magic resistance) rolls percentile dice. If the roll is higher than the creature's magic resistance, the spell has a normal effect. If the roll is equal to or less than the creature's magic resistance, the spell has absolutely no effect on the creature.

Effects of Magic Resistance 
	Magic resistance enables a creature to ignore the effects of spells and spell-like powers. It does not protect the creature from magical weapon attacks or from natural forces that may be a direct or accidental result of a spell. Nor does it prevent the protected creature from using his own abilities or from casting spells and using magical items. It can be effective against both individually targeted spells and, within limits, area-effect spells.
	If a magic resistance roll fails, and the spell has normal effect, the target can make all saving throws normally allowed against the spell.

When Magic Resistance Applies 
	Magic resistance applies only if the successful casting of a spell would directly affect the resistant creature or item. Thus, magic resistance is effective against magic missile (targeted at a creature or item) or fireball (damaging the area the creature or item is in) spells.
	Magic resistance is not effective against an earthquake caused by a spell. While the creature may suffer injury or death falling into a chasm the spell opens under its feet, the magical energy of the spell was directed at the ground, not the creature. Magic resistant creatures are not immune to events that occur as the consequence of spells, only to the direct energy created or released by a spell.
	Player characters do not normally have magic resistance (though they still get saving throws vs. magical spells and such); this ability is reserved mainly for special monsters.

Successful Magic Resistance Rolls 
	A successful magic resistance check can have four different results, depending on the nature of the spell being resisted:
	Individually Targeted Spells: By definition, these spells affect just one creature, and only the targeted creature rolls for magic resistance (if it has any). If a spell of this type is directed at several targets, each rolls independently of the others. (An example of this would be a hold person spell aimed at four creatures, with each creature getting a magic resistance roll, if they have magic resistance.)
	If the magic resistance roll is successful, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the spell is targeted only at the creature, the spell fails completely and disappears. If several targets are involved, the spell may still affect others who fail their magic resistance roll.
	Area-Effect Spells: These spells are not targeted on a single creature, but on a point. The spell's effect encompasses everything within a set distance of that point. A successful magic resistance check enables the creature to ignore the effect of the spell. However, the spell is not negated and still applies to all others in the area of effect.
	In-Place Spells: These spells operate continuously in a particular place or on a particular creature, character, or item. Protection from evil is one example of this kind of spell.
	Magic resistance comes to play only if a creature or item finds himself (or itself) in the place where the spell is in operation. Even then, magic resistance may not come into play--nothing happens if the spell isn't of a type that affects the character. Thus, a part water spell would not collapse simply because a magic resistant creature walked through the area. A protection from evil spell, which could affect the creature, would be susceptible to magic resistance.
	If the DM determines that a magic resistance roll is appropriate, and the roll succeeds, the in-place spell collapses (usually with a dramatic thunderclap and puff of smoke).
	Permanent Spells: Magic resistance is insufficient to destroy a permanent spell. Instead, the spell is negated (within the same guidelines given for in-place spells) for as long as the magic resistant creature is in the area of effect.
	Thus, a magic-resistant creature might be able to step through a permanent wall of force as if it weren't there. However, the wall would spring back into existence as soon as the creature passed through (i.e., no one else can pass through).

Turning Undead 
	One important, and potentially life-saving, combat ability available to certain clerics and paladins is the ability to turn undead. This is a special power granted by the character's deity.
	Through the cleric or paladin, the deity manifests a portion of its power, terrifying evil, undead creatures or blasting them right out of existence. However, since the power must be channeled through a mortal vessel, success is not always assured.
	When encountering undead, a cleric or paladin can attempt to turn the creatures (remember that the paladin turns undead as if he was two levels lower--a 5th-level paladin uses the level 3 column). Only one attempt can be made per character per encounter, but several different characters can make attempts at the same time (with the results determined individually).

	*An additional 2d4 creatures of this type are turned.
	**Special creatures include unique undead, free-willed undead of the Negative Material Plane, certain Greater and Lesser Powers, and those undead that dwell in the Outer Planes.
	Paladins turn undead as clerics who are two levels lower.

	Attempting to turn counts as an action, requiring one round and occurring during the character's turn in the initiative order (thus, the undead may get to act before the character can turn them). The mere presence of the character is not enough--a touch of drama from the character is important. Speech and gestures are important, so the character must have his hands free and be in a position to speak. However, turning is not like spellcasting and is not interrupted if the character is attacked during the attempt.
	To resolve a turning attempt, look on the table above.  Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of the undead with the level of the character (two levels lower for a paladin). If there is a number listed, roll 1d20. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than that listed, the attempt is successful. If the letter "T" (for "turned") appears, the attempt is automatically successful without a die roll. If the letter "D" (for "dispel") is given, the turning utterly destroys the undead. A dash (--) means that a cleric or paladin of that level cannot turn that type of undead. A successful turn or dispel affects 2d6 undead. If the undead are a mixed group, the lowest Hit Dice creatures are turned first.
	Only one die is rolled regardless of the number of undead the character is attempting to turn in a given round. The result is read individually for each type of undead.
	Turned undead bound by the orders of another (for example, skeletons) simply retreat and allow the character and those with him to pass or complete their actions.
	Free-willed undead attempt to flee the area of the turning character, until out of his sight. If unable to escape, they circle at a distance, no closer than ten feet to the character, provided he continues to maintain his turning (no further die rolls are needed).
	If the character forces the free-willed undead to come closer than ten feet (by pressing them into a corner, for example) the turning is broken and the undead attack normally.

Evil Clerics and Undead 
	Some evil clerics are normally considered to be in league with undead creatures, or at least to share their aims and goals. Thus, they have no ability to turn undead. However, they can attempt to command these beings.
	This is resolved in the same way as a turning attempt. Up to 12 undead can be commanded. A "T" result means the undead automatically obey the evil cleric, while a "D" means the undead become completely subservient to the evil cleric. They follow his commands (to the best of their ability and understanding) until turned, commanded, or destroyed by another.
	Evil clerics also have the ability to affect paladins, turning them as if they were undead. However, since the living spirit of a paladin is far more difficult to quell and subvert, paladins are vastly more difficult to turn.
	An evil cleric attempting to turn a paladin does so as if the cleric were three levels lower than he actually is. Thus, a 7th-level evil cleric would turn paladins on the 4th-level column. He would have only a slim chance of turning a 7th-level paladin (7 HD) and would not be able to turn one of 8th level at all (using the level of the paladin as the HD to be turned). All "D" results against paladins are treated as "T" results.

Injury and Death 
Sometimes, no degree of luck, skill, ability, or resistance to various attacks can prevent harm from coming to a character. The adventuring life carries with it unavoidable risks. Sooner or later a character is going to be hurt.
	To allow characters to be heroic (and for ease of play), damage is handled abstractly in the AD&D game. All characters and monsters have a number of hit points. The more hit points a creature has, the harder it is to defeat.
	Damage is subtracted from a character's (or creature's) hit points. Should one of the player characters hit an ogre in the side of the head for 8 points of damage, those 8 points are subtracted from the ogre's total hit points. The damage isn't applied to the head, or divided among different areas of the body.
	Hit point loss is cumulative until a character dies or has a chance to heal his wounds.

Wounds 
	When a character hits a monster, or vice versa, damage is suffered by the victim. The amount of damage depends on the weapon or method of attack.  All weapons are rated for the amount of damage they inflict.
	Each time a hit is scored, the appropriate dice are rolled and the damage is subtracted from the current hit points of the target. An orc that attacks with a sword, for example, causes damage according to the information given for the type of sword it uses. A troll that bites once and rends with one of its clawed hands causes 2d6 points of damage with its bite and 1d4 + 4 points with its claw. (The DM gets this information from the Monstrous Manual supplement.)
	Sometimes damage is listed as a die range along with a bonus of +1 or more. The troll's claw attack, above, is a good example. This bonus may be due to high Strength, magical weapons, or the sheer ferocity of the creature's attack. The bonus is added to whatever number comes up on the die roll, assuring that some minimum amount of damage is caused. Likewise, penalties can also be applied, but no successful attack can result in less than 1 point of damage.
	Sometimes an attack has both a die roll and a damage multiplier. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by the multiplier to determine how much damage is inflicted. This occurs mainly in backstabbing attempts. In cases where damage is multiplied, only the base damage caused by the weapon is multiplied. Bonuses due to Strength or magic are not multiplied; they are added after the rolled damage is multiplied.
     Characters who are rendered unconscious by wounds will lose 1 hit point per round until attended to and have their wounds bound.  This applies to any character with a hit point total of 0 to -9 hit points.  A wounded, unconscious character will cease to lose hit points on the round that he or she is attended to.

Special Damage 
Getting hit by weapons or monsters isn't the only way a character can get hurt. Indeed, the world is full of dangers for poor, hapless player characters, dangers the DM can occasionally spring on them with glee. Some of the nastier forms of damage are described below.

Falling 
	Player characters have a marvelous (and, to the DM, vastly amusing) tendency to fall off things, generally from great heights and almost always onto hard surfaces. While the falling is harmless, the abrupt stop at the end tends to cause damage.
	When a character falls, the standard falling damage is 1d6 per 10 feet fallen per 100 pounds of body weight and equipment carried, with no maximum limit on number of dice.

Paralysis 
	A character or creature affected by paralysis becomes totally immobile for the duration of the spell's effect. The victim can breathe, think, see, and hear, but he is unable to speak or move in any manner. Coherent thought needed to trigger magical items or innate powers is still possible.
	Paralysis affects only the general motor functions of the body and is not the ultimate destroyer of powerful creatures. It can be particularly potent on flying creatures, however.

Energy Drain 
	This is a feature of powerful undead (and other particularly nasty monsters). The energy drain is a particularly horrible power, since it causes the loss of one or more experience levels!
	When a character is hit by an energy-draining creature, he suffers normal damage from the attack. In addition, the character loses one or more levels (and thus, Hit Dice and hit points). For each level lost, roll the Hit Dice appropriate to the character's class and subtract that number of hit points from the character's total (subtract the Constitution bonus also, if applicable). If the level(s) lost was one in which the character received a set number of hit points rather than a die roll, subtract the appropriate number of hit points. The adjusted hit point total is now the character's maximum (i.e., hit points lost by energy drain are not taken as damage but are lost permanently).
	The character's experience points drop to halfway between the minimum needed for his new (post-drain) level and the minimum needed for the next level above his new level.
	Multi-class and dual-class characters lose their highest level first. If both levels are equal, the one requiring the greater number of experience points is lost first.
	All powers and abilities gained by the player character by virtue of his former level are immediately lost, including spells. The character must instantly forget any spells that are in excess of those allowed for his new level. In addition, a magic user loses all understanding of spells in his spell books that are of higher level than he can now cast. Upon regaining his previous level, the spellcaster must make new rolls to see if he can relearn a spell, regardless of whether he knew it before.
	If a character is drained to 0 level but still retains hit points (i.e., he is still alive), that character's adventuring career is over. He cannot regain levels and has lost all benefits of a character class. The adventurer has become an ordinary person. A restoration or wish spell can be used to allow the character to resume his adventuring career. If a 0-level character suffers another energy drain, he is slain instantly, regardless of the number of hit points he has remaining.
	If the character is drained to less than 0 levels (thereby slain by the undead), he returns as an undead of the same type as his slayer in 2d4 days. The newly risen undead has the same character class abilities it had in normal life, but with only half the experience it had at the beginning of its encounter with the undead who slew it.  The new undead is automatically an NPC! His goals and ambitions are utterly opposed to those he held before. He possesses great hatred and contempt for his former colleagues, weaklings who failed him in his time of need. Indeed, one of his main ambitions may be to destroy his former companions or cause them as much grief as possible.  Furthermore, the newly undead NPC is under the total control of the undead who slew it. If this master is slain, its undead minions gain one level for each level they drain from victims until they reach the maximum Hit Dice for their kind. Upon reaching full Hit Dice, these undead are able to acquire their own minions (by slaying characters).
	Appropriate actions on the part of the other player characters can prevent a drained comrade from becoming undead. The steps necessary vary with each type of undead and are explained in the monster descriptions in the Monstrous Manual supplement.

Poison 
	This is an all-too frequent hazard faced by player characters. Bites, stings, deadly potions, drugged wines, and bad food all await characters at the hands of malevolent magic users, evil assassins, hideous monsters, and incompetent innkeepers. Spiders, snakes, centipedes, scorpions, wyverns, and certain giant frogs all have poisons deadly to characters. Wise PCs quickly learn to respect and fear such creatures.
	The strength of different poisons varies wildly and is frequently overestimated. The bite of the greatly feared black widow spider kills a victim in the United States only once every other year. Only about 2% of all rattlesnake bites prove fatal.
	At the other extreme, there are natural poisons of intense lethality. Fortunately, such poisons tend to be exotic and rare--the golden arrow-poison frog, the western taipan snake, and the stonefish all produce highly deadly poisons.
	Furthermore, the effect of a poison depends on how it is delivered. Most frequently, it must be injected into the bloodstream by bite or sting. Other poisons are only effective if swallowed; assassins favor these for doctoring food. By far the most deadly variety, however, is contact poison, which need only touch the skin to be effective.
	Paralytic poisons leave the character unable to move for 2d6 hours. His body is limp, making it difficult for others to move him. The character suffers no other ill effects from the poison, but his condition can lead to quite a few problems for his companions.
	Debilitating poisons weaken the character for 1d3 days. All of the character's ability scores are reduced by half during this time. All appropriate adjustments to attack rolls, damage, Armor Class, etc., from the lowered ability scores are applied during the course of the illness. Furthermore, the character moves at one-half his normal movement rate. Finally, the character cannot heal by normal or magical means until the poison is neutralized or the duration of the debilitation is elapsed.

Treating Poison Victims
	Fortunately, there are many ways a character can be treated for poison. Several spells exist that either slow the onset time, enabling the character the chance to get further treatment, or negate the poison entirely. However, cure spells (including heal) do not negate the progress of a poison, and neutralize poison doesn't recover hit points already lost to the effects of poison. In addition, characters with herbalism proficiency can take steps to reduce the danger poison presents to player characters.

Healing 
Once a character is wounded, his player will naturally want to get him healed. Characters can heal either by natural or magical means. Natural healing is slow, but it's available to all characters, regardless of class. Magical healing may or may not be available, depending on the presence (or absence) of spellcasters or magical devices.
	The only limit to the amount of damage a character can recover through healing is the total hit points the character has. A character cannot exceed this limit until he gains a new level, whereupon another Hit Die (or a set number of points) is added to his total. Healing can never restore more hit points to a character than his maximum hit point total.

Natural Healing 
	Characters heal naturally at a rate of 1 hit point per day of rest. Rest is defined as low activity--nothing more strenuous than riding a horse or traveling from one place to another. Fighting, running in fear, lifting a heavy boulder, or any other physical activity prevents resting, since it strains old wounds and may even reopen them.
	If a character has complete bed rest (doing nothing for an entire day), he can regain 3 hit points for the day. For each complete week of bed rest, the character can add any Constitution hit point bonus he might have to the base of 21 points (3 points per day) he regained during that week.
	In both cases above, the character is assumed to be getting adequate food, water, and sleep. If these are lacking, the character does not regain any hit points that day.

Magical Healing 
	Healing spells, potions, and magical devices can speed the process of healing considerably. The specifics of such magical healing methods are described in the spell descriptions in this book and in the DMG (for magical items). By using these methods, wounds close instantly and vigor is restored. The effects are immediate.
	Magical healing is particularly useful in the midst of combat or in preparation for a grievous encounter. Remember, however, that the characters' opponents are just as likely to have access to magical healing as the player characters--an evil high cleric is likely to carry healing spells to bestow on his own followers and guards. Healing is not, of itself, a good or evil act.
	Remember that under no circumstances can a character be healed to a point greater than his original hit point total. For example, say a character has 30 hit points, but suffers 2 points of damage in a fight. A while later, he takes an additional point of damage, bringing his current hit point total to 27. A spellcaster couldn't restore more than 3 points to him, regardless of the healing method used. Any excess points are lost.

Herbalism & Healing Proficiencies 
	Characters can also gain minor healing benefits from those proficient in the arts of herbalism and healing. These talents are explained in Chapter 5.

Character Death 
     Character death occurs at -10 hit points, with one and only one exception : If a character is dying from shock, non-respiration, blood loss, etc. ( i.e. losing hit points at a rate of 1 per round after being stricken unconscious from wounds, and at 0 to -9 hp ), the character will not die, but will still reach -10 hp, if the character is given aid on the exact same round that he or she reaches -10 hit points.

Death From Poison 
	Poison complicates this situation, somewhat. A character who dies as a result of poisoning may still have active venom in his system.
	Poisons remain effective for 2d6 hours after the death of the victim. If the character is raised during this time, some method must be found to neutralize the poison before the character is restored to life. If this is not done, then after the character rolls the resurrection survival check as given in "Raising the Dead" later in this chapter (and assuming the roll is successful), he must immediately roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer all the effects of the poison in his body, as per the normal rules. This may only injure some characters, but it may kill other characters seconds after being raised!

Death From Massive Damage 
	In addition to dying when hit points reach -10, a character also runs the risk of dying abruptly when he suffers massive amounts of damage. A character who suffers 50 or more points of damage from a single attack must roll a successful saving throw vs. death, or he dies.  This applies only if the damage was done by a single attack. Multiple attacks totaling 50 points in a single round don't require a saving throw.
	For example, a character would be required to make a check if a dragon breathed on him for 72 points of damage. He wouldn't have to do so if eight orcs hit him for a total of 53 points of damage in that round.
	If the saving throw is successful, the character remains alive (unless of course the 50-hit-point loss reduced his hit points to -10 or below!). If the saving throw fails, the character immediately dies from the intense shock his body has taken. His hit points are reduced to -10.  The character may still be raised in the normal ways, however.

Inescapable Death 
	There are occasions when death is unavoidable, no matter how many hit points a character has.
	A character could be locked in a room with no exits, with a 50-ton ceiling descending to crush him. He could be trapped in an escape-proof box filled completely with acid. These examples are extreme (and extremely grisly), but they could happen in a fantasy world.

Raising the Dead 
	Curative and healing spells have no effect on a dead character--he can only be returned to life with a raise dead or resurrection spell (or a device that accomplishes one of these effects). Each time a character is returned to life, the player must make a resurrection survival roll based on his current Constitution). If the die roll is successful (i.e., the player rolls equal to or less than his resurrection survival percentage), the character is restored to life in whatever condition is specified by the spell or device.
	A character restored to life in this way has his Constitution permanently lowered by 1 point. This can affect hit points previously earned. Should the character's Constitution bonus go down, the character's hit point total is reduced by the appropriate number of hit points (the amount of hit point bonus lost is multiplied by the number of levels for which the character gained extra hit points from that bonus). When the character's Constitution drops to 0, that character can no longer be raised. He is permanently removed from play.


Chapter 10: 
Treasure 

     Hidden out there in the campaign world are great treasures awaiting discovery. Ancient dragons rest on huge hordes of gold, silver, and gems.   Some treasures, like those of dragons, are gathered and horded for reasons fully understood only by their collectors. Others are gathered for more mundane purposes--power, luxury, and security. A rare few troves date from eons before, their owners long dead and forgotten. Some treasure hordes are small, such as the pickings of a yellow mold. Others are enormous, such as the Tyrant King's treasury. Treasures may be free for the taking or fiercely trapped and watched over.

Treasure Types 
     Treasure comes in many different forms and sizes, ranging from the mundane to the exotic. There are of course coins of copper, silver, gold, electrum, and platinum. But precious metals can also be shaped into gilded cups, etched bowls, or even silverware. Characters know the value of coins and will have no difficulty establishing their worth in most cases. However, ancient treasure hordes may contain coins no longer used. It may be that these can be sold only by their weight. Objects made of valuable metal are even more difficult to appraise. Either the characters must find a metalsmith who can value the item and a buyer willing to pay a fair price, or these too must be melted down for their metal. In large cities this is not too difficult. There are always appraisers and fences handy, although getting full value might be difficult. (Accusations of theft are another small problem.) Characters must be aware of cheats and counterfeiters though. An apparently valuable bowl could actually be base metal plated in silver. The metal of coins could be debased with copper or brass. Weights could be rigged to give false prices. Characters must find merchants they can trust.
	Gems are another common form of treasure and here player characters are even more dependent on others. Unless the party has a skilled appraiser of precious stones, they're going to have to trust others. After all, those red stones they found in the last treasure could be cheap glass, richly colored but only marginally valuable quartz, semi-precious garnets, or valuable rubies. Again, the player characters are going to have to find a jeweler they can trust and be watchful for cheats and scams. However, truly tricky DMs might present your characters with uncut gems. These are almost impossible for the untrained eye to spot or appraise. Most characters (and most players) are not going to realize that a piece of unremarkable stone can be a valuable gem when properly cut.
	Perhaps the most difficult of all treasure items to appraise are objects of artistic value. While gems cut or uncut are valuable, their worth can be greatly increased when used in a piece of jewelry. Gold is valuable by weight, but even more so when fashioned into a cup or pin. Dwarven craftsmen from hidden communities practice the finest arts of gem cutting, while gnomish artisans in earthen burrows labor away on elaborate gold and silver filigrees. Ancient elven carvings, done in exquisitely grained woods, stand side by side with the purest of statues chiseled by man. All of these have a value that goes far beyond their mere materials.
	But artistic creations seldom have a fixed value. Their price depends on the player characters finding a buyer and that person's willingness to buy. A few large cities may have brokers in arts, merchants who know the right people and are willing to act as go-betweens. Most of the time, however, the player characters have to go to the effort of peddling their wares personally. This requires tact and delicacy, for such items are seldom bought by any but the wealthy and the wealthy often do not like stooping to business negotiations. Player characters must carefully avoid giving insult to the barons, dukes, counts, and princes they might deal with.
	Finally, there are the truly unusual things your character can find--furs, exotic animals, spices, rare spell components, or even trade goods. As with art objects, the values of these items are highly subjective. First the player characters have to find a buyer. This is not too difficult for everyday things, such as furs or trade goods, but it can be a tremendous enterprise if you have a spell component that is useful only to the most powerful of magic users. Next the PCs must haggle about the price. Furriers and merchants do this as a matter of course. Others haggle because they hope the PCs do not know the true value of what they hold or because they themselves do not know. After all this, the PCs might be able to sell their goods. However, if you enter into this in the true spirit of role-playing and see it as part of the adventure, the whole process is enjoyable.

Magical Items 
     The treasures mentioned thus far are all monetary. Their usefulness is immediate and obvious. They give characters wealth, and with wealth comes power and influence. However, there are other treasures, very desirable ones, that your characters will not want to sell or give away. These are the magical items that your characters find and use.  Although clerics and magic users can make magical items (according to the guidelines your DM has for magical research), it is far more common for characters to find these items during the course of adventures. Magical items are powerful aids for characters. With them, characters can gain bonuses in combat, cast spells with the mere utterance of a word, withstand the fiercest fire, and perform feats impossible by any other known means. Not all magical items are beneficial, however. Some are cursed, the result of faulty magical construction or, very rarely, the deliberate handiwork of some truly mad or evil magic user.  A very few magical items are artifacts--items created by beings more powerful than the greatest player characters. These are perilously dangerous items to use. There are only three methods to determine how to use artifacts--dumb luck, trial and error, and diligent research.
	There are many different magical items your character can find, but they all fall into a few basic categories. Each type of magical item has properties you should be aware of.
	Magical Weapons: There can be a magical version of nearly any type of normal weapon, although there are admittedly few magical bardiches or guisarme-voulges. By far the most common magical weapons are swords and daggers. A magical weapon typically gives a +1 or greater bonus to attack rolls, increasing a character's chance to hit and cause damage. Perhaps magical swords are quicker on the attack, or maybe they're sharper than normal steel--the explanation can be whatever the DM desires. Whatever the reason, magical weapons give results far beyond those of even the finest-crafted nonmagical blade.
	A rare few weapons have even greater powers. These may allow your character to sense danger, heal wounds, float in midair, or have the most amazing luck. The rarest of the rare can actually communicate with your character and are imbued with an otherworldly intelligence. While the most powerful of magical weapons, these clever instruments of destruction sometimes seek to impose their wills on their owners.
	When you find a magical weapon, more than likely you do not know its properties. Some functions, such as the advantage it gives you in combat, can be learned by trial and error. Other properties must be learned through research and spells. Ancient histories and legend lore spells can provide information on the properties of your weapon. On rare occasions, properties are discovered through blind luck. Simply commanding the weapon to activate one power after another (hoping it will suddenly spring to life) works only for the most minor abilities--detecting danger, spotting secret doors, or locating treasure. Greater abilities require that specific commands be uttered, perhaps in long-forgotten languages.
	Magical Armor: Enchanted armors are the complements to magical weapons. These armors have a +1 or better bonus to their normal Armor Class, being made of stuff stronger and finer than nonmagical armor. Furthermore, these armors grant some measure of protection against attacks that normal armors would not stop. Chain mail +1, for instance, improves the character's saving throw against the fiery breath of a dragon by 1, thus providing more than just a physical shield. In rare instances, armor may possess extraordinary powers. Although such armors are generally finely made and elaborately engraved. characters can discover the armors' powers only by the same methods they use to discover the powers of magical weapons.
	Potions and Oils: Magical potions and oils are easily found but hard to identify. They come in small bottles, jugs, pots, or vials and clearly radiate magic if a detection spell is used. However, the effect of any potion is unknown until some brave soul tries a small sample. The results can be quite varied. The imbiber may discover he can float or fly, resist great heat or cold, heal grievous wounds, or fearlessly face the greatest dangers. He may also find himself hopelessly smitten by the first creature he sees or struck dead by a powerful poison. It is a risk that must be taken to learn the nature of the potion.
	Scrolls: Scrolls are a convenience and luxury for spellcasters. By reading the incantation written on the pages, the cleric or magic user can instantly cast that spell. He does not need to memorize it, have the material components handy, or do any of the things normal spellcasting requires. Experienced and powerful magic users normally spend their evenings preparing such scrolls for their own adventuring use.
	Some scrolls are usable by all characters, granting special but temporary protections from various dangers--evil creatures, werewolves, powerful beings from other planes, etc. Other scrolls bear hideous or humorous curses, brought into effect at the mere reading of their titles. Unfortunately, the only way to know what a scroll contains is to silently scan its contents. For scrolls containing magic user spells, this may require the use of a read magic spell. Other scrolls can be read by all. This scan does not cast the spell written on the scroll, but it tells the character what is written there (and exposes him to the effects of curses). Once the scroll is read, it can be used at any time in the future by that character.
	Rings: Magical rings are usable by many different classes and bestow a wide range of powers, from pyrotechnic displays to wishes. While the aura of a magical ring can be detected, its properties cannot be discovered until it is worn.  Some rings may have a command word or other special properties which make it ineffective unless the proper conditions are met.   As with all magical items, some rings can harm your character. Worse still, cursed rings can be removed only with the aid of spells!
	Wands, Staves, and Rods: These are among the most powerful of standard magical items. Wands are commonly used by magic users, allowing them to cast powerful spells with the flick of a wrist. Staves can be used by either a magic user or a cleric. Staves can be truly destructive, dwarfing even the potential of a wand. Rods are the rarest of all, the accouterments of witch-kings and great lords. With rods come dominance and power.  Fortunately for your character, few of these items are cursed or dangerous to handle. But all must be operated by a command word--a specific word or phrase that triggers the power within. No wand, stave, or rod shows any indication of its powers by mere sight or handling. Careful research and probing are most often needed to tap the potential stored within.  Wands, staves, and rods are not limitless in their power. Each use drains them slightly, using up a charge. There is no power gauge or meter showing what is left. A character discovers his wand is drained only when it no longer functions or suddenly crumbles into useless dust.
	Miscellaneous Magic: Miscellaneous magical items are where the true variety of magical treasures lies. Each item possesses some unique power. There are horseshoes to make your horse go faster, brooms to ride, sacks that hold more than they should, paints that create real things, girdles that grant great strength, caps to make your character smarter, books that increase ability scores, and much, much more. Each item is different and not all can be identified in the same way. The effects of some become obvious the instant the item is handled, donned, or opened. Others require research and questioning to learn the command word needed to activate them. All are quite valuable and rare.
	Artifacts and Relics: Finally, there are artifacts and relics. Don't count on your PC ever finding one of these rarest of all magical items. Even if your character does find one, think carefully before you decide to let him keep it permanently. Artifacts are the most powerful magical items in the game. Indeed, many are powerful enough to alter the course of history! They are all unique and have unique histories. You can never find more than one Hand of Vecna in a world. Because it is so unique, each artifact has special and significant powers. Artifacts never appear by accident; they are always placed by the DM.
	Finding artifacts is always the result of a very special adventure. Your DM has placed that artifact for a reason. It is not likely that he really intends for your characters to keep it. Instead, he has something arranged in which you need that artifact for a specific purpose. The problem with keeping artifacts is that they are too powerful. Not only do they unbalance your character in the short run, they also eventually corrupt and destroy him. The magical power of artifacts is such that they destroy their owners sooner or later. There is a price to be paid for power, and it is not a cheap one.

Dividing and Storing Treasure 
	Once your group completes a successful adventure, it is almost certain to have collected some treasure. Therefore, it helps to have some prearranged agreement about how this treasure is to be divided among the different player characters and their henchmen. This is a true role-playing decision that must be reached among all the players at the table. There are no rules about how your characters should divide treasures.  However, there are some suggested methods and reasons to make or not make some agreements. If you bear these in mind, you will have fewer arguments and bad feelings between the different players and their characters in your group.
	Cash treasure is the easiest. The most direct and simplest method is equal shares for all player characters and full or half shares for all henchmen. A player may argue that his character's contribution was greater than that of other characters, but these things average out in the long run. Besides, that player has no real idea of the contribution of others. A character who guarded the rear may have discouraged hidden opponents from springing an ambush on the group, something that only the DM knows.  Additional considerations include extraordinary costs. Some adventuring groups establish a special fund to pay the costs (if there are any) of healing, resurrecting, or restoring fellow player characters. Again this works on the principle that all faced the danger and therefore all should share equally in the expenses. Other groups make allowances for differing character levels (higher level characters assumedly shouldered more of the burden of the adventure, and so should be rewarded proportionately.) Some parties give special rewards to those who took greater chances or saved others. These encourage everyone in the group to take part.
	Magical treasure is more difficult to divide up, since there is rarely enough to give a useful item to every character, nor are all items of equal value or power. Here you must rely more on your sense of fairness if you wish to maintain party harmony. Since magical items are worthwhile to a party only if they can be used, your first concern should normally be to get the right item into the right hands. A magical sword in the possession of a magic user is not nearly as useful as it would be in the hands of a fighter. Likewise, a wand does a fighter little good but could be a potent addition to a magic user. Therefore it is a good idea to match items to characters.  Alternatively, your party could determine the price an item would sell for, and then make it available to any PC who is willing to give the rest of the party that amount of money. If more than one player is willing to pay the price, the interested players could roll dice to see who gets the item. Or, for items that several characters could all use equally well (such as a potion of healing that is useful to all), the characters can bargain with each other and roll dice for choices. A player character may relinquish a claim on one magical item in exchange for another. A character who has already received a magical item may not be allowed another choice if there are not enough pieces to go around. If no other agreement can be reached, the players can roll dice and have their characters pick in descending order. It is a fair method (since people cannot rightfully complain about a random roll), but it can create imbalances. One or two characters could wind up with the bulk of the magical items over the course of several adventures. At this point, they would be wise to voluntarily withdraw from the selection process.
	There are tactical issues to think about when distributing treasure. It is simply not wise for one or two characters to carry the bulk of the party's magical items. Successful adventurers spread their gear throughout their party. (This holds true even for explorers and special forces in the real world.) This way, if one character falls off the cliff and disappears forever or is spirited away by an invisible stalker, the party has not lost everything.
	Once your characters have assembled a sizeable amount of treasure, they have to find some place to keep it. If your DM is running a fairly medieval campaign, one thing PCs are not going to find is a bank like today's. Instead, your characters must find other ways to keep their money secure. Chests with strong locks are a good start, but there are still better methods. One choice is to make the treasure small enough that you can carry it with you at all times. (Of course, one good mugging and you're broke.) There is also the difficulty of buying a drink with a 1,000-gp gem. A second choice is to place your money in the hands of someone you think you can trust. We all know what the risks are there. You could have your character give his fortune to a local lord or church and then hope to call in favors at a future date. This is not quite as foolish as it sounds. If the beneficiary of your largess refuses to honor your agreement, you'll never give him money again and neither will anyone else, most likely. If no one gives him any money, where will he find the funds to support his lifestyle? No, such a person must seriously try to honor his commitments. Of course, he may not do as much as you would like. The best solution is that used throughout history--buy goods and chattels. Land, livestock, and trade goods are harder to steal and harder to lose. If you must keep a large fortune, it is best to keep it in something that can be carried easily and is unlikely to be stolen.





Chapter 11: 
Encounters 

Whenever a player character meets an NPC (nonplayer character), fights a monster, or even discovers a mysterious fountain in the woods, he is having an encounter. An encounter is any significant thing a character meets, sees, or interacts with during the course of a game. When a player character discovers a fountain of blue flame in the midst of the forest, its very strangeness forces the character to react and the player to think.  Few characters are going to pass this by as just another flaming fountain in the forest.
	Encounters are vital to the AD&D game, for without them nothing can really happen to the player character. An adventure without encounters is like sitting in a room all day with no one to talk to and little to look at. It certainly wouldn't be very exciting.  Encounters provide danger, risk, mystery, information, intrigue, suspense, humor, and more.  For an encounter to provide excitement, it must also have an element of danger. A good deal of this comes from the fact that player characters don't know how the encountered beings will react to them.  Not knowing for sure is what keeps you on your toes. They could be anything!
	When your character travels or explores a dungeon, your DM will have prepared two general types of encounters. The first are specific (planned) encounters. These are meetings, events, or things the DM has chosen to place in the adventure to build on the story of the adventure.
	Specific encounters generally have more choices of action--your DM may want you to discover some important information or set up a particularly difficult battle. Specific encounters usually yield greater treasures and more magical items. Creatures may be placed by the DM to guard the armory or prevent the characters from reaching the throne room.
	Random encounters normally involve simple choices--run away, fight, or ignore. Sometimes characters can talk to creatures in random encounters and learn valuable information, but not often. Random encounters also tend to have little or no treasure. A patrol of city guardsmen does not carry as many valuable items on its rounds as it would have in its barracks. Random encounters are most often used to weaken PCs, raise an unexpected alarm, hurry them along, or just make their lives difficult.
	Sometimes encounters are not with people or monsters but with things. The fountain in the forest is an encounter, but your characters cannot fight it or talk to it (well, maybe not). So what are you supposed to do? In these cases, the encounter is more of a puzzle. You have to figure out why this fountain is here, what it can do, and if it is important to your adventure. It may be a red herring--something placed there just to confuse you; it may be a set up for a future adventure--later on your characters may learn that the flaming fountain they saw is important to their latest mission. It may be a deadly trap. To find out, though, you will have to deal with the thing in some way. You could throw stones into the pool, drink the glowing water, try to walk through the flames, or use spells to learn more. By doing these things, you may get more information from your DM. Of course, you may not like the answer!

The Surprise Roll 
	Sometimes an encounter, either random or planned by the DM, catches one of the two groups involved totally off guard. This is called surprise and is determined by rolling 1d10 for each side (or only one side if the DM has decided that one of the sides cannot be surprised, for some reason). If the die roll is a 1, 2, or 3, that group or character is surprised (for effects, see the "Effects of Surprise" section). Naturally, surprise does not happen all the time. There are many easy and intelligent ways it can be prevented. The most obvious is if the player characters can see those they are about to encounter well before getting close.
	The DM decides when a check for surprise must be made. He can require that one roll be made for the entire party, that a separate check be made for each character, or that only specific characters check. This depends entirely upon the situation.
	The surprise roll can also be modified by Dexterity, race, class, cleverness, and situation. The DM has the listing of modifiers that apply to given situations. Modifiers can affect either your character's chance of being surprised or his chance of surprising others. A plus to your die roll reduces the odds that you are surprised; a minus increases those odds. Likewise, a minus to the enemy's die roll means that the modifier is in your favor, while a plus means that things are going his way. High Dexterity characters are virtually unsurpriseable, caught off guard only in unusual situations.
	It is important to bear in mind that surprise and ambush are two different things. Surprise works as explained above. An ambush is prepared by one group to make an unexpected attack on another group and works only if the DM decides the other group cannot detect the ambush. A properly set ambush gives the attackers the opportunity to use spells and normal attacks before the other side reacts. If the ambush succeeds, the ambushing group gets its initial attack and the other group must roll for surprise in the next round, so the ambushing group may get two rounds of attacks before the other group can reply.

Effects of Surprise 
	Characters and monsters that are surprised all suffer the same penalty. They are caught off guard and thus cannot react quickly. The surprising group receives one round of attacks with melee, missile, or magical items. They cannot use these moments of surprise to cast spells.
	A ranger on the unsurprised side could fire his long bow twice (two attacks per round) before his opponents could even hope to react. A fighter able to attack twice per round could attempt both hits before any initiative dice are rolled. A magic user could unleash a bolt from his wand of lightning before the enemy knew he was there. Of course, what applies to player characters also applies to monsters, so that the leopard in the earlier example could claw and bite before the characters even knew what was happening.
	The second effect of surprise is that the surprised characters lose all AC bonuses for high Dexterity during that instant of surprise. The surprised characters are dumbfounded by the attack. Instead of ducking and countering, they're just standing there rather flat-footed (maybe even with dumb expressions on their faces). Since they don't grasp the situation, they cannot avoid the hazards and dangers very well.
	Surprise can also be used to avoid an encounter. Unsurprised characters can attempt to flee from a surprised group before the other group reacts. Of course, this is not always successful, since escape is greatly dependent upon the movement rates of the different creatures.
	If both groups manage to surprise each other, the effects of surprise are cancelled. For example, Rath runs around the corner straight into some lounging guardsmen. Taken by surprise, he stops suddenly and frantically looks for someplace else to run. The guardsmen in turn look up rather stupidly, trying to figure out why this dwarf just raced around the corner. The surprise passes. Rath spots another alley and the guards decide that since he's running, Rath must be a criminal. Initiative rolls are now made to see who acts first.

Encounter Distance 
	Once your character or party has an encounter and it has been determined whether or not anyone was surprised, your DM will tell you the range of the encounter--the distance separating you from the other group. Many factors affect encounter distance. These include the openness of the terrain, the weather conditions, whether surprise occurred, and the time of day, to name a few. Although you do not know the exact distance until your DM tells you, surprise, darkness, or close terrain (woods, city streets, or narrow dungeons) usually results in shorter encounter distances, while open ground (deserts, plains, or moors), good light, or advance warning results in greater encounter distances (see Chapter 13: Vision and Light).

Encounter Options 
	Once an encounter occurs, there is no set sequence for what happens next. It all depends on just what your characters have encountered and what they choose to do. That's the excitement of a role-playing game--once you meet something, almost anything could happen. There are some fairly common results of encounters, however.
	Evasion: Sometimes all you want is for your characters to avoid, escape, or otherwise get away from whatever it is you've met. Usually this is because you realize your group is seriously outmatched. Perhaps returning badly hurt from an adventure, your group spots a red dragon soaring overhead. You know it can turn your party to toast if it wants. Rather than take that risk, your group hides, waiting for it to pass. Or, topping a ridge, you see the army of Frazznargth the Impious, a noted warlord. There are 5,000 of them and six of you. Retreat seems like the better part of valor, so you turn your horses and ride.
	Sometimes you want to avoid an encounter simply because it will take too much time. While riding with an urgent message for his lord, your character rides into a group of wandering pilgrims. Paying them no mind, he lashes his horse and gallops past.
	Evading or avoiding an encounter is not always successful. Some monsters pursue; others do not. In the examples above, Frazznargth the Impious (being a prudent commander) orders a mounted patrol to chase the characters and bring them in for questioning. The pilgrims, on the other hand, shout a few oaths as your galloping horse splashes mud on them and then continue on their way. Your character's success at evading capture will depend on movement rates, determination of pursuit, terrain, and just a little luck. Sometimes when he really should be caught, your character gets lucky. At other times, well, he just has to stand his ground.
	Talk: Your character doesn't run from encounters all the time, and attacking everything you meet eventually leads to problems. Sometimes the best thing to do is talk, whether it's casual conversation, hardball negotiation, jovial rumor-swapping, or intimidating threats. In fact, talking is often better than fighting. To solve the problems your DM has created for your character, you need information. Asking the right questions, developing contacts, and putting out the word are all useful ways to use an encounter. Not everything you meet, human or otherwise, is out to kill your character. Help often appears in the most surprising forms. Thus it often pays to take the time to talk to creatures.
	Fight: Of course, there are times when you don't want to or can't run away. (Running all the time is not that heroic.) And there are times when you know talking is not a good idea. Sooner or later, your character will have to fight. The real trick is knowing when to fight and when to talk or run. If you attack every creature you meet, the first thing that will happen is that nobody will want to meet with your character. Your character will also manage to kill or chase off everyone who might want to help him. Finally, sooner or later your DM is going to get tired of this and send an incredibly powerful group of monsters after your character. Given the fact that you've been killing everything in sight, he's justified in doing this.
	So it is important always to know who you are attacking and why. As with the best police in the world today, the trick is to figure out who are the bad guys and who are the good guys. Make mistakes and you pay. You may kill an NPC who has a vital clue, or unintentionally anger a baron far more powerful than yourself. NPCs will be reluctant to associate with your character, and the law will find fewer and fewer reasons to protect him. It is always best to look on combat as a last resort.
	Wait: Sometimes when you encounter another group, you don't know what you should do. You don't want to attack them in case they are friendly, but you don't want to say anything to provoke them. What you can do is wait and see how they react. Waiting is a perfectly sensible option. However, there is the risk that in waiting, you lose the advantage should the other side suddenly decide to attack. Waiting for a reaction so that you can decide what to do causes a +1 penalty to the first initiative roll for your group, if the other side attacks.
	Of course, in any given encounter, there may be many other options open to your character. The only limit is your imagination (and common sense). Charging a band of orcs to break through their lines and flee may work. Talking them down with an elaborate bluff about the army coming up behind you might scare them off. Clever use of spells could end the encounter in sudden and unexpected ways. The point is, this is a role-playing game and the options are as varied as you wish to make them.




Chapter 12: 
NPCs 

Player characters cannot fight, survive, wheel, deal, plot, or scheme without interacting with nonplayer characters (NPCs). Indeed, the very heart of the AD&D game is the relationship between player characters and nonplayer characters. How the player characters react to and treat NPCs determines the type of game the group plays. Although many choices are possible, players quickly find that consideration and good treatment of NPCs is the most frequently successful route.
	An NPC is any person, creature, or monster that is controlled by the DM. Most NPCs are either people (intelligent races that live in local society) or monsters (intelligent and unintelligent creatures that aren't normally found in towns and villages). The term "monster" is only a convenient label. It doesn't mean the creature is automatically dangerous or hostile. Likewise, NPCs who are people aren't uniformly helpful and cooperative. As with all things, the range of possible reactions of NPCs to PCs covers the entire spectrum.
	In the course of their adventures, player characters will be most concerned with three groups of NPCs: hirelings, followers, and henchmen. It is their aid that helps player characters vanquish deadly monsters and accomplish mighty deeds. As their names imply, these NPCs can be persuaded in various ways to join the player characters in their adventures. The most common methods of persuasion are money and loyalty.

Hirelings 
The most frequently employed NPC is the hireling. A hireling is a person who works for money. Most hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts of specialized adventuring skills. Typical hirelings include the following:

Archer	Architect
Armorer	Assassin
Baker	Blacksmith
Bladesmith	Foot Soldier
Jeweler	Laborer
Messenger	Minstrel
Sage	Sailor
Spy	Thief

	Hirelings are always employed for a stated term of service or for the performance of a specific task. Thus, a mercenary contracts to serve for one season. A thief can be hired to steal a named item. A sage works to answer a single question. A blacksmith may indenture himself for a term of years. A sailor works for a single voyage. Quite often these contracts can be renewed without difficulty, but the only thing that binds a hireling to the player character is regular pay and good treatment. Hirelings do not serve a PC out of any great loyalty.
	Thus there are some things hirelings will not do. Most hirelings do not foolishly risk their lives. There are soldiers willing to take their chances on the field of battle, but even these courageous (or foolish) few do not willingly undertake the greater hazards of adventuring. They man castle walls, guard caravans, collect taxes, and charge the massed foe well enough, but they often refuse to accompany a PC on an adventure. Even a hireling who regularly undertakes dangerous missions (a thief or an assassin, for example) normally refuses to join player character parties. These hirelings are loners. They contract to do a job and get it done in their own way, without interference from anyone else.
	Hirelings are no more loyal than human nature allows. For the most part, if paid and treated well, with opportunities to realize their ambitions, working for a charismatic leader, hirelings can be relied on to do their jobs faithfully. But poor pay, injustice, discrimination, threats, abuse, and humiliation at the hands of their masters make them somewhat less than reliable. A smart leader sees to the comfort and morale of his men before his own concerns. With less savory characters--those hired to perform dark deeds--the player character takes even greater chances, especially given the questionable morals of such characters.
	Whatever their personalities, hirelings generally need to make morale checks (explained in the DMG) whenever they are faced with a particularly dangerous situation or are offered a bribe or other temptation.
	Finding hirelings is not difficult. People need jobs. It is simply a matter of advertising. Under normal circumstances, applicants respond to ads. Only when trying to employ vast numbers or hire those with unusual specialties (such as spies) does the process become complicated. Just what needs to be done in this situation depends entirely upon the DM's campaign. Your character may have to skulk through the unsavory bars of the waterfront, rely on questionable go-betweens, or pay a visit to the thieves' guild (if there is one). Just employing one of these characters can be a small adventure in itself.
	Employment costs of hirelings vary from a few gold pieces a month to thousands of gold pieces for an especially dangerous task. The skill and experience of a hireling has a great effect on his salary. A learned sage researching some obscure piece of lore can charge hefty sums. Costs can also be affected by the conditions of the campaign--the setting, the recent events of the world, and the reputations of the player characters (if any). Most hirelings sign on for what they think is fair. While few will turn down more money, most will drive the best bargain they can. Your DM has more information about employment costs, since he may need to alter these to fit his campaign.

Followers 
	More reliable than those who are motivated purely by money are those characters who, while they expect pay, were originally drawn into service by the reputation of the player character. These are followers, usually a unit of soldiers of one type or another. Followers serve only those of significant power and reputation, thus the construction of a stronghold is necessary to attract followers.
	Followers have the same needs and limitations of hirelings. Most must be paid and well-treated. They also do not accompany the player characters on group adventures. They have some advantages over hirelings, however. Followers do not serve for a specific term of contract. They remain with the player character as long as their basic needs are met. They are more loyal than the average hireling and are treated as elite troops. Unlike most hirelings, followers can increase in level (although this occurs very slowly since they act only as soldiers). All followers in a unit advance to the next level at the same time. Finally, the player character need not seek out followers--they come to him, seeking out positions within his illustrious household.
	Followers appear only once. Replacements do not arrive to fill the ranks of the fallen. (Massive losses of followers in combat only gives the character a bad reputation, discouraging others from flocking to his banner.) Player characters should take care of their followers, perhaps treating them as an elite bodyguard.
	Some characters attract unique followers such as animals or magical beings. Although termed followers, these creatures are more properly treated as henchmen in terms of loyalty and what they will and will not do. They do not count against the character's limit on henchmen, however, since they are technically followers.

Henchmen 
	Henchmen are much that hirelings are not. They are adventurers who serve out of loyalty. They are willing to risk their lives for those they respect. They are also hard to find.  Henchmen are powerful allies to a player character. Unlike hirelings, they have the nerve and ability to become powerful adventurers. Although they expect their share of treasure, they do not usually join a player character for money. They are attracted to the PC because of his reputation or other qualities he possesses. As such, henchmen cannot be expected to flock to the banner of a neophyte adventurer. He may gain himself one or two companions, but others come only when he has earned a greater reputation, met more people, and proven himself a true friend and ally to these NPCs.
	Henchmen can come from any source. Most often they are at first mere hirelings or followers who, through distinctive actions, come to the attention of the player character. Some may be higher level, more skilled hirelings who develop a bond to the player character through long employment. Others may be followers who have sound advice for the player character.
	A henchman is always of lower level than the PC. Should he ever equal or surpass the PC's level, the henchman leaves forever; it is time for him to try his luck in the real world. In some ways, the player character is the mentor and the henchman his student. When the student has learned as much as the teacher, it is time for him to go out on his own.
	Henchmen are more than just loyal followers; they are friends and allies. Naturally, they expect to be treated as such. They have little need for those who do not trust them or treat them coldly. Abusiveness or taking advantage of the friendship quickly ends the relationship. Just as players must with their own friends, player characters must be sensitive to the needs and feelings of their henchmen. Furthermore, henchmen attach themselves to a particular player character, not a group of player characters. Thus it is only under the direst of circumstances that a henchman accepts the orders of another PC. Should his friend (the player character) fall, the henchman sees to his needs. He doesn't abandon him and continue on with the other player characters unless this is clearly the only way to aid his friend.
	A PC's Charisma determines the maximum number of henchmen he can have. This is a lifetime limit, not just a maximum possible at any given time. In a world where the fallen can be restored to life, it is expected that a man would make this effort for his dearest friends, both player characters and henchmen.
	Attracting a henchman is fairly difficult. One cannot advertise for friends with any great success. They grow and develop from other relationships. A henchman can be found by placing trust in a skilled hireling. Heroic deeds (saving the life of an NPC) can create a strong and instant bond. Love certainly can form this bond. The player and the DM must trust their own judgment to determine when an NPC becomes a henchman. There is no clear line an NPC must cross to make the transition from hireling to henchman. Instead, it is a slide from one status to the other.
	There are certain things henchmen do not do. They do not give away or loan out magical items. They do not allow others free access to their spell books. They do not tolerate spell use that questions their loyalty (detect lie or know alignment cast upon them). They do not accept less than their due share. In general, within these limits, henchmen do what is desired of them. The DM can at any time dictate the actions of a henchman, since the character is still an NPC.
	If a PC is not attentive to the wishes and needs of his henchmen, or if he abuses and humiliates them, he can expect the worst. This is the stuff mutinies and rebellions are made of. Should an abusive player character fall at the hands of a once-loyal henchman, he has only himself to blame.
	On the other hand, not all henchmen are paragons of loyalty. The player character must always be aware that henchmen are sometimes not what they seem. They can be a means to get at the player character. Throughout history, many a cruel and cunning villain has posed as a true companion, waiting for his chance to strike or spy on his friend.

Player Character Obligations 
	Whenever a player character takes on a hireling, follower, or henchman, he has committed himself to certain obligations and customs that surround such agreements. Some of these are obvious, having been worked out between the player character and the NPC in advance. Usually the wage and term of service are settled upon before any agreement is reached. For hirelings and followers, this is a set amount of money each day, week, or month, or a fee for a specific task. Henchmen commonly receive a portion of all treasure and magic found on adventures. A player character is normally expected to contribute a little more from his own funds, however.
	Other obligations of the player character are varied. Some must always be considered, while others almost never come into effect. A player character is expected to provide meals and boarding (unless the NPC has a home nearby). This is the most common obligation and applies to NPCs of all walks of life. For those engaged in more dangerous pursuits, however, additional concessions must be granted. Since horses are expensive, player characters should be ready to cover the cost of mounts lost in combat or on campaign. It is unreasonable to expect a mercenary to buy a new mount from his meager savings. Likewise, other items of war craft--weapons and armor--must be replaced by the player character. All soldiers are expected to provide their own equipment when they are first employed, but the player character must replace all losses. Certainly all player characters are expected to pay the cost of special transport--securing passage on ships and arranging wagons for baggage. Of the grimmer duties, player characters are expected to pay for a decent (though hardly lavish) interment.  One of the more unusual obligations of a player character is to ransom his men. This is especially true of men lost during a campaign. The greater number of soldiers lost in a battle are not slain but captured. Common practice of the medieval period was to officially ransom these prisoners for well-established prices. A common yeoman footman might ransom for 2 gp, a minor cleric for 80 gp, a knight's squire for 200 gp, and a king's man for 500 gp. These are paid for by the lord of the prisoner. A player character (as a lord and master) is expected to do the same. Of course, the player character can pass much of this cost on to his own subjects and the relatives of the prisoner. Thus men might languish for long periods in the hands of the enemy before their ransom was raised. Furthermore, should a player character ransom a hireling, follower, or henchman, he has every reason to expect loyal service from that man in the future. After all, he has demonstrated his willingness to save that NPC from hardship and death.
	In a fantasy world, a player character is also expected to bear the cost of magical spells cast to the benefit of his men. He may arrange to have his men blessed before battle or healed after it. He shouldn't grumble about the expense, because the spells also make good tactical sense. The bless spell increases the success of his army in the field. Magical cures get his army back on its feet quicker. All these things can make him very successful while also making him popular with his hired men.
	Finally, the player character is expected to make an effort to raise or restore slain henchmen. This is not a normal expectation of hirelings or followers (although it can happen in extreme cases). The effort should be honest and true. A player character shouldn't fool himself into thinking no one will notice if he doesn't do his utmost. The player character who returns from an adventure minus his henchman is automatically under a cloud of suspicion, despite his most vehement protests. A player character must take great care to maintain his reputation as a good and upright employer.




Chapter 13: 
Vision and Light 

     Before a character can do anything in the dungeon or the wilderness, he has to be able to see what he is doing. If a character can't see a target, his chances of hitting it are very small. If he can't see, he can't read a scroll or a large "Keep Out" sign on the wall. In the AD&D game, characters can see set distances and often by fantastic means that defy logic.

Limits of Vision 
	The first limitation on vision is how far away an object can be before it cannot be seen clearly. Size and weather have a great effect on this. Mountains can be seen from great distances, 60 to 100 miles or more, yet virtually no detail can be seen. On level ground, the horizon is about five to 12 miles away, but a character usually cannot see a specific object that far away. The limit of vision for seeing and identifying man-sized objects is much less than this.
	Under optimum conditions, the maximum range at which a man-sized object can be seen is about 1,500 yards, if it is moving. If the object doesn't move, it usually cannot be seen at this distance. Even if it is moving, all that can be seen is a moving object. The character cannot tell what it is or what it is doing.
	At 1,000 yards, both moving and stationary man-sized objects can be spotted. General size and shape can be determined, but exact identifications are impossible. It is not likely that creature type can be identified at this range, unless the creature has a very unique shape.
	At 500 yards, general identifications can be made. Size, shape, color, and creature type are all distinguishable. Individuals still cannot be identified, unless they are distinctively dressed or separated from the rest of the group. Livery and heraldic symbols or banners can be seen if large and bold. Most coats of arms cannot be distinguished at this distance. General actions can be ascertained with confidence.
	At 100 yards, individuals can be identified (unless, of course, their features are concealed). Coats of arms are clear. Most actions are easily seen, although small events are unclear.
	At 10 yards, all details but the smallest are clear. Emotions and actions are easily seen, including such small actions as pick-pocketing (if it is detectable).
	Of course, conditions are seldom perfect. There are a number of factors that can reduce visibility and alter the ranges at which things can be spotted and identified. Table 62 lists the effects of different types of conditions.
	All ranges are given in yards.
	"Movement" indicates the maximum distance at which a moving figure can be seen. "Spotted" is the maximum distance a moving or a stationary figure can be seen. "Type" gives the maximum distance at which the general details of a figure can be seen--species or race, weapons, etc. "ID" range enables exact (or reasonably exact) identification. "Detail" range means small actions can be seen clearly.
	There are many factors other than weather that affect viewing. Size is an important factor. When looking at a small creature (size S), all categories are reduced to the next lower category (except the "detail" range, which remains unchanged). Thus, under clear conditions, the ranges for seeing a small creature are "movement" at 1,000 yards, "spotted" at 500 yards, "type" at 100 yards, and "ID" and "detail" at 10 yards.
	When sighting large creatures, the "movement," "spotting," and "type" ranges are doubled. Exceptionally large creatures can be seen from even greater distances. Large groups of moving creatures can be seen at great distances. Thus, it is easy to see a herd of buffalo or an army on the march.
	The ranges given in the table below do not take terrain into account. All ranges are based on flat, open ground. Hills, mountains, tall grass, and dense woods all drastically reduce the chances of seeing a creature. (The terrain does not alter sighting ranges, only the chances of seeing a creature.) Thus, even though on a clear day woods may hide a bear until he is 30 yards away, it is still a clear day for visibility. The bear, once seen, can be quickly and easily identified as a bear. The DM has more information on specific terrain effects on sighting.



Visibility Ranges

Condition		Movement	Spotted	             Type	ID	Detail
Clear sky	1,500	1,000	500	100	10
Fog, dense or blizzard	     10	     10	    5	    5	  3
Fog, light or snow	   500	   200	100	  30	10
Fog, moderate	   100	     50	  25	  15	10
Mist or light rain	1,000	   500	250	  30	10
Night, full moon	   100	     50	  30	  10	  5
Night, no moon	     50	     20	  10	    5	  3
Twilight	    500	   300	150	  30	10


	As a final caveat, the ranges in the table assume Earthlike conditions. Sighting conditions on one of the Lower Planes, or the horizon distance on another world, could be entirely different. If your DM feels he must take this into account, he will have to learn more about this subject at his local library or make it up.

Light 
     Most characters cannot see much without light. Some night conditions (those for the outdoors) are given in the table above, but all of these assume some small amount of light. In totally lightless conditions, normal vision is impossible, unless a source of light is carried by the party.
	Light sources vary in the area they affect. The table below gives the radius of light and burning time for the most common types of light sources.

Light Sources

Source			Radius	             Burning time
Beacon lantern	240 ft.*	30 hrs./pint
Bonfire	50 ft.	1/2 hr./armload
Bullseye lantern	60 ft.*	2 hrs./pint
Campfire	35 ft.	1 hr./armload
Candle	  5 ft.	10 min./inch
Continual light	60 ft.	Indefinite
Hooded lantern	30 ft.	2 hrs./pint
Light spell	20 ft.	Variable
Torch	15 ft.	30 min.
Weapon**	  5 ft.	As desired

	* Light from these is not cast in a radius, but rather in a cone-shaped beam. At its far end, the cone of light from a beacon lantern is 90 feet wide. A bullseye lantern has a beam 20 feet wide at its far end.
	** Magical weapons shed light if your DM allows this optional rule.

	Of course, while a lantern or fire enables characters to see, it does have some disadvantages. The greatest of these is that it is hard to sneak up on someone if he can see you coming. It is hard to remain inconspicuous when you have the only campfire on the plain, or you are carrying the only torch in the dungeon. Furthermore, not only do creatures know you are coming, they can generally see you before you see them (since the light source illuminates the area around you, those outside this area can see into the area). Characters should always bear these risks in mind.



Infravision 
     Infravision is the ability to see light in the infrared spectrum.  Characters and creatures with infravision are basically picking up radiating heat from their surroundings, thus all they see are variations in temperature.  They do not see things which are the same temperature as their surroundings.  
     Light sources which also give off heat absolutely prevent normal infravision from functioning properly within their sphere of illumination.  It requires not less than two segments to accustom the eyes to infravision after use of normal vision.

Ultravision
     Ultravision is the ability to see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.  This allows creatures which posess it to see outdoors on dark nights as if he or she were in twilight (as the sun still bombards the earth with UV radiation), but it is of little use in underground settings unless there is some source of ultraviolet radiation to use as a source of illumination.

Using Mirrors 
	At times it is useful for characters to look at objects or creatures via reflections in a mirror. This is particularly true of those creatures so hideous (such as a medusa) that gazing directly upon them might turn the viewer to stone. When using a mirror, a light source must be present. Second, attempting to direct your actions by looking in a mirror is very disorienting (try it and see). Thus, all actions requiring an ability or proficiency check or an attack roll suffer a -2 penalty. The character also loses all Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class if fighting an opponent seen only in a mirror.





Chapter 14: 
Time and Movement 

     As in the real world, time passes in all AD&D game worlds. Weeks slip away as magic users research spells. Days go by as characters ride across country. Hours pass while exploring ruins. Minutes flash by during battles. All of these are passages of time.
	There are two different types of time that are talked about in these rules. Game time is the imaginary time that passes for the characters in the game. Real time is the time in the real world, the time that passes for the players and DM as they play the AD&D game. The two times are very different; players and DMs should be careful to distinguish game time from real time.
	The importance of game time is that as a campaign progresses, characters tend to become involved in different time-consuming projects. Three characters may set off on a four-week overland journey, while a magic user researches for six weeks. At the inn, a fighter rests and heals his wounds for two weeks. It is important to note how much time passes during different tasks, so the activities of different characters can be followed.
	Campaign time is measured just as it is in real life: years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. But, since this is a fantasy game, the DM can create entirely different calendars for his world. There may be only 10 months in the year or 63 days to a month. When beginning play, these things are not tremendously important, so players need not worry about them right away. With continued adventuring, players eventually become familiar with the calendar of the campaign.
	Rounds and turns are units of time that are often used in the AD&D game, particularly for spells and combat. A round is approximately equal to a minute (it is not exactly one minute, so as to grant the DM some flexibility during combat). A turn is equal to 10 minutes of game time. Turns are normally used to measure specific tasks (such as searching) and certain spells. Thus, a spell that lasts 10 turns is equal to 100 minutes or one and two-thirds hours.

Movement 
     Closely related to time is movement. Clearly your character is able to move; otherwise, adventures would be rather static and boring. But how fast can he move? If a large, green carrion crawler is scuttling after Rath, is the redoubtable dwarf fast enough to escape? Could Rath outrun an irritated but heavily loaded elf? Sooner or later these considerations become important to player characters.
	All characters have movement rates that are based on their race. The table below lists the movement rates for unencumbered characters of different races.

Base Movement Rates

Race		Rate
Human	12
Dwarf	  6
Elf	12
Half-elf	12
Gnome	  6
Halfling	  6

	A character can normally walk his movement rate in tens of yards in a single round. An unencumbered human can walk 120 yards (360 feet), slightly more than a football field, in one minute. A dwarf, similarly equipped, can walk 60 yards in the same time. This walk is at a fairly brisk, though not strenuous, pace that can be kept up for long periods of time.
	However, a character may have to move slower than this pace. If the character is carrying equipment, he may move slower because of the encumbrance, if this optional rule is used (see "Encumbrance" in Chapter 6: Money and Equipment). As the character carries more gear, he gradually slows down until he reaches the point where he can barely move at all.
	When a character is moving through a dungeon or similar setting, his movement rate corresponds to tens of feet per round (rather than the tens of yards per round of outside movement). It is assumed that the character is moving more cautiously, paying attention to what he sees and hears while avoiding traps and pitfalls. Again, this rate can be lowered if the optional encumbrance system is used.
	Characters can also move faster than the normal walking pace. In the dungeon (or anytime the character is using his dungeon movement rate), the character can automatically increase his movement to that of his normal walking pace. In doing so, however, he suffers a -1 penalty to his chance of being surprised and gives a +1 bonus to others on their chance of being surprised by him (the rapidly moving character is not taking care to conceal the noise of his passage in the echoing confines of the underground). Furthermore, the character does not notice traps, secret doors, or other unusual features.
	It is also certainly possible for a character to jog or run--an especially useful thing when being chased by creatures tougher than he cares to meet. The simplest method for handling these cases is to roll an initiative die. If the fleeing character wins, he increases the distance between himself and his pursuers by 10 times the difference in the two dice (in feet or yards, whichever the DM feels is most appropriate). This is repeated each turn until the character escapes or is captured. (If this seems unrealistic, remember that fear and adrenaline can do amazing things!)

Jogging and Running 
	If your DM wants greater precision in a chase, the speeds of those involved in the chase can be calculated exactly. (But this is time-consuming and can slow down an exciting chase.) Using this optional rule, a character can always double his normal movement rate (in yards) to a jog. Thus, a character with a movement rate of 12 can jog 240 yards in a round. While jogging, a character can automatically keep going for the number of rounds equal to his Constitution. After this limit has been reached, the player must roll a successful Constitution check at the end of each additional round spent jogging. There are no modifiers to this check. Once a Constitution check is failed, the character must stop and rest for as many rounds as he spent jogging. After this, he can resume his jogging pace with no penalties (although the same limitations on duration apply).
	If a jogging pace isn't fast enough, a character can also run. If he rolls a successful Strength check, he can move at three times his normal rate; if he rolls a Strength check with a -4 penalty, he can quadruple his normal rate; if he rolls a Strength check with a -8 penalty, he can quintuple his normal rate. Failing a Strength check means only that the character cannot increase his speed to the level he was trying to reach, but he can keep running at the pace he was at before the failed Strength check. Once a character fails a Strength check to reach a level of running, he cannot try to reach that level again in the same run.
	Continued running requires a Constitution check every round, with penalties that depend on how long and how fast the character has been running. There is a -1 penalty for each round of running at triple speed, a -2 penalty for each round of running at quadruple speed, and a -3 penalty for each round of running at quintuple speed (these penalties are cumulative). If the check is passed, the character can continue at that speed for the next round. If the check is failed, the character has exhausted himself and must stop running. The character must rest for at least one turn.

Cross-Country Movement 
	A normal day's marching lasts for 10 hours, including reasonable stops for rest and meals. Under normal conditions, a character can walk twice his movement rate in miles in those 10 hours. Thus, an unencumbered man can walk 24 miles across clear terrain.
	Characters can also force march, intentionally hurrying along, at the risk of exhaustion. Force marching enables a character to travel 2 1/2 times his movement rate in miles (thus, a normal man could force march 30 miles in a day). At the end of each day of the march, the character or creature must roll a Constitution check. Large parties (such as army units) make the check at the average Constitution of the group (weaker members are supported, encouraged, and goaded by their peers). Creatures must roll a saving throw vs. death at the end of each day's force marching (since they lack Constitution scores). A -1 penalty is applied to the check for each consecutive day spent force marching. If the check is passed, the force marching pace can be continued the next day. If the check fails, no more force marching attempts can be made until the characters have completely recovered from the ordeal. Recovery requires half a day per day of force marching.
	Even if the Constitution check fails, the character can continue overland movement at his normal rate.
	One drawback of force marching is that each day of force marching results in a -1 penalty to all attack rolls. This modifier is cumulative. Half a day's rest is required to remove one day's worth of force marching penalty. Characters who have managed to force march for eight straight days suffer a -8 penalty to their attack rolls; it takes four days of rest to return to no attack roll penalty.
	Overland movement rates can be increased or decreased by many factors. Terrain can speed or slow movement. Well-tended roads allow faster marching, while trackless mountains slow marches to a snail's pace. Lack of food, water, and sleep weaken characters. Poor weather slows their pace. All these factors are detailed in the DMG.

Swimming 
	All characters are either untrained swimmers or proficient swimmers.
	When the DM determines the swimming ability of characters, the decision should be based on his campaign. If the campaign is centered around a large body of water, or if a character grew up near the sea, chances are good that the character knows how to swim. However, being a sailor does not guarantee that a character can swim. Many a medieval mariner or black-hearted pirate never learned how to swim and so developed a morbid fear of the water! This is one of the things that made "walking the plank" such a fearful punishment. Furthermore, some character races are normally suspicious of water and swimming. While these may vary from campaign to campaign, dwarves and halflings often don't know how to swim.
	Untrained swimmers are a fairly hapless lot. When they are unencumbered, they can manage a rough dog-paddle in relatively calm waters. If the waters are rough, the current strong, or the depth excessive (at sea or far out on a lake), untrained swimmers may panic and sink. If weighed down with enough gear to reduce their movement rate, they sink like stones, unable to keep their heads above water. In no way do they make any noticeable progress (unless, of course, the object is to sink beneath the surface).
	Proficient swimmers are able to swim, dive, and surface with varying degrees of success. All proficient characters are able to swim half their current land movement rate times 10 in yards, provided they are not wearing metal armor. A character with a movement rate of 12 could swim 60 yards (180 feet) in a round. Characters whose movement rates have been reduced to 1/3 or less of normal (due to gear) or who are wearing metal armor cannot swim--the weight of the gear pulls the character under. They can still walk on the bottom, however, at 1/3 their current movement rate.
	Proficient swimmers can double their swimming speed, if a successful Strength check is rolled (vs. half the character's normal Strength score). For a character with a movement rate of 12, a successful check means he can swim 120 yards in one round, an Olympic-class performance.
	Like running, swimming is not something that a character can do indefinitely. There are several different speeds a character can choose to swim at, thus moving in either short sprints or a slower, but longer-lasting, pace.
	If swimming at half normal speed or treading water, the character can maintain this for a number of hours equal to his Constitution score (although he will have to abandon most of his gear). After a character swims for a number of hours equal to his Constitution, a Constitution check must be made for each additional hour. For each extra hour of swimming, 1 Constitution point is temporarily lost (regaining lost ability points is explained in the next column).
	Each hour spent swimming causes a cumulative penalty of -1 to all attack rolls.
	All this assumes calm water. If the seas are choppy, a Constitution check should be made every hour spent swimming, regardless of the character's Constitution. Rough seas can require more frequent checks; heavy seas or storms may require a check every round. The DM may decide that adverse conditions cause a character's Constitution score to drop more rapidly than 1 point per hour.
	If a swimming character fails a Constitution check, he must tread water for half an hour before he can continue swimming (this counts as time spent swimming, for purposes of Constitution point loss).  A character drowns if his Constitution score drops to 0.
	Characters can also swim long distances at a faster pace, although at increasing risk. Swimming at the character's normal movement rate (instead of the usual swimming speed of half the normal movement rate) requires a Constitution check every hour, reduces Strength and Constitution by 1 point every hour, and results in a -2 cumulative attack penalty for each hour of swimming. Characters can swim at twice this speed (quadruple normal swimming speed), but they must roll a check every turn and suffer the above penalties for every turn spent swimming. Again, when an ability score reaches 0, the character sinks and drowns.
	Upon reaching shore, characters can recover lost ability score points and negate attack penalties by resting. Each day of rest recovers 1d6 ability points (if both Strength and Constitution points were lost, roll 1d3 for each ability to determine points recovered) and removes 2d6 points of attack penalties. Rest assumes adequate food and water. Characters need not be fully rested before undertaking any activity, although the adjusted ability scores are treated as the character's current scores until the character has rested enough to fully recover from the swim.

Holding Your Breath 
	Under normal circumstances (with a good gulp of air and not performing strenuous feats), a character can hold his breath up to 1/3 his Constitution score in rounds (rounded up). If the character is exerting himself, this time is halved (again, rounded up). Characters reduced to 1/3 or less of their normal movement because of encumbrance are always considered to be exerting themselves. If unable to get a good gulp of air, these times are reduced by 1/2. All characters are able to hold their breath for one round, regardless of circumstances.
	While attempting to hold his breath beyond this time, the character must roll a Constitution check each round. The first check has no modifiers, but each subsequent check suffers a -2 cumulative penalty. Once a check is failed, the character must breathe (if he cannot reach the surface, he drowns).
	Diving: All characters can dive to a depth of 20 feet in a single round. For each encumbrance category above unencumbered (or for each point of movement below the character's normal rate, if this optional system is used; see "Encumbrance" in Chapter 6), two feet are added to this depth (the additional weight helps pull the character down). A short run or a few feet of height adds 10 feet of depth to the first round of a dive. For every 10 feet of height above the water, an additional five feet of depth is added, up to a maximum addition of 20 feet. Thus, with a run and from a height of 40 feet or more, an unencumbered man can dive 50 feet in a single round.
	Surfacing: A character can normally rise at the rate of 20 feet per round. This rate is reduced by two feet for every encumbrance category above unencumbered or for every point of current movement below the character's normal rate (if this optional system is used). Note that, under the optional encumbrance system, heavily loaded characters (those who have lost 10 or more points off their normal movement rate because of their current encumbrance) cannot even swim to the surface. Those simply floating to the surface (unconscious characters, for example) rise at a rate that is five feet per round slower than someone similarly encumbered who is actively swimming up to the surface. It is quite possible for a moderately weighed-down character to sink if he makes no effort to stay on the surface.

Climbing 
	Although thieves have specialized climbing abilities, all characters are able to climb to some degree or another. Climbing ability is divided into three categories: thief, mountaineer, and unskilled.
	Thieves are the most skilled at climbing. They are the only characters who can climb very smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces without the use of ropes or other equipment. They are the fastest of all climbers and have the least chance of falling.
	Mountaineers are characters with mountaineering proficiency or those the DM deems to possess this skill. They have a better climbing percentage than unskilled characters. Mountaineers with proper equipment can climb very smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces. They can assist unskilled characters in all types of climbs.
	Unskilled climbers are the vast majority of characters. While they are able to scramble over rocks, they cannot use climbing equipment or negotiate very smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces. They have the lowest climbing success rate of all characters.

Calculating Success 
	The chance of success of a climb is calculated by taking the character's skill level (given as a percentage) and modifying it for his race, the condition of the surface, and situational modifiers. The table below lists the percentages for the different categories of climbers.
	The chance of success given in the table is modified by many factors. Some of these remain the same from climb to climb (such as a character's race) and can be figured into the character's base score. Others depend on the conditions of a given climb.  A Climbing check is made by rolling percentile dice. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number found from the following tables, the character succeeds with the Climbing check. Rolls above this number indicate failure.
	A Climbing check must be made any time a character tries to climb a height of 10 feet or more. This check is made before the character ascends the first 10 feet of the climb. If the check is passed, the character can continue climbing. If the check is failed, the character is unable to find a route and cannot even attempt the climb.  No further attempts can be made by that character until a change occurs. This is either a significant change in location (a half mile or more along the face of a cliff) or an improvement in the character's chance of success.

Base Climbing Success Rates

Category					Success Rate
Thief with mountaineering proficiency *	Climb walls % + 10%
Thief	Climb walls %
Mountaineering proficiency *	40% + 10% per proficiency slot
Mountaineer (decided by DM)	50%
Unskilled climber	40%

	* Only if the optional proficiency system is used.

	  	On particularly long climbs--those greater than 100 feet or requiring more than one turn (10 minutes) of climbing time--the DM may require additional checks. The frequency of these checks is for the DM to decide. Characters who fail a check could fall a very long way, so it is wise to carry ropes and tools.

Climbing Rates 
	Climbing is different from walking or any other type of movement a character can do. The rate at which a character moves varies greatly with the different types of walls and surfaces that must be climbed. Refer to the table below.  Cross-reference the type of surface to be climbed with the surface condition. Multiply the appropriate number from the table by the character's current movement rate. The result is the rate of climb for the character, in feet per round, in any direction (up, down, or sideways).  All the movement rates given on the table are for nonthief characters. Thief characters are able to climb at double the movement rate for normal characters.

Types of Surfaces 
	Very smooth surfaces include expanses of smooth, uncracked rock, flush-fitted wooden walls, and welded or bolted metal walls. Completely smooth walls, unbroken by any feature, cannot be climbed by anyone without tools.
	Smooth and cracked walls include most types of well-built masonry, cavern walls, maintained castle walls, and slightly eroded cliff faces.
	Rough faces are most natural cliffs, poorly maintained or badly built masonry, and typical wooden walls or stockades. Any natural stone surface is a rough face.
	Rough with ledges is similar to rough faces but is dotted with grips three inches or more wide. Frost-eroded cliffs and natural chimneys are in this category, as are masonry buildings falling into ruin.
	Ice walls are cliffs or faces made entirely of frozen ice. These are different from very smooth and smooth surfaces in that there are still many natural cracks and protrusions. They are extremely dangerous to climb, so a Climbing check should be made every round for any character attempting it without tools.
	Trees includes climbs with an open framework, such as a scaffold, as well as trees.
	Sloping walls means not quite clifflike but too steep to walk up. If a character falls while climbing a sloping wall, he suffers damage only if he fails a saving throw vs. petrification. If the save is made, the character slides a short distance but is not harmed.
	Rope and wall require that the character uses a rope and is able to brace himself against a solid surface.

Rates of Climbing

                         ------------------ Surface Condition ----------------------
Type of Surface	             Dry	Slightly Slippery          Slippery
Very smooth *	1/4	--**	--**
Smooth, cracked *	1/2	1/3	1/4
Rough *	1	1/3	1/4
Rough w/ledges	1	1/2	1/3
Ice wall	--	--	1/4
Tree	4	3	2
Sloping wall	3	2	1
Rope and wall	2	1	1/2

	* Nonthief characters must be mountaineers and have appropriate tools (pitons, rope, etc.) to climb these surfaces.
	** Thief characters can climb very smooth, slightly slippery surfaces at 1/4. However, even thieves cannot climb very smooth, slippery surfaces.



Actions While Climbing 
	Although it is possible to perform other actions while climbing, such as spellcasting or fighting, it is not easy. Spellcasters can use spells only if they are in a steady, braced position, perhaps with the aid of other characters.  Climbing characters lose all Armor Class bonuses for Dexterity and shield and most often have rear attack modifiers applied against them also. Their own attack, damage, and saving throw rolls suffer -2 penalties. Those attacking from above gain a +2 bonus to their attack rolls, while those attacking from below suffer an additional -2 penalty to their attack rolls.  A climbing character cannot use a two-handed weapon while climbing. The DM can overrule these penalties if he feels the player character has reached a place of secure footing. If struck while climbing (for any amount of damage), the character must make an immediate Climbing check. Failure for a roped character means he spends a round regaining his balance; an unroped character falls if he fails this check.

Climbing Tools 
	Tools are an integral part of any mountaineer's equipment and all climbs can profit from the use of tools. Mountaineering tools include rope, pitons (spikes), and ice axes. However, it is a mistaken belief that the main function of tools is to aid in a climb. The main purpose of pitons, rope, and the like is to prevent a disastrous fall. Climbers must rely on their own skills and abilities, not ropes and spikes, when making a climb. Accidents happen when people forget this basic rule and trust their weight to their ropes and pitons.
	Therefore, aside from ropes, other tools do not increase the chance of climbing success. However, in the case of a fall, climbing tools can reduce the distance fallen. When a character falls, he can fall only as far as the rope allows, if being belayed, or as far as twice the distance to the last piton set (if the piton holds--a piton pulls free 15% of the time when a sudden stress occurs). The distance fallen depends on how far apart the pitons have been set. Falling characters fall twice the distance to the last piton that holds.
	Roping characters together increases individual safety, but it also increases the chance that more than one person falls. When a character falls, the character(s) on either side of the falling climber must roll Climbing checks (a penalty of -10 is applied for each falling character after the first one to fall). If all checks are successful, the fall is stopped and no one suffers any damage. If a check is failed, that character also falls and Climbing checks must be repeated as before. Climbing checks are made until either the fall is stopped (the climbers on either side of the falling character[s] successfully roll Climbing checks or the last nonfalling climber succeeds with his check), or all the roped-together characters fall.

Getting Down 
	Aside from jumping or flying, the quickest way to get down from a height is to rappel. This requires a rope attached at the top of the climb and a skilled mountaineer to set up the rappel and to hold the rope at the bottom. When rappeling down a surface, a Climbing check with a +50 bonus must be rolled. Free rappels (with the end of the rope unsupported at the bottom) are also possible, but the modifier is only +30. Of course, a failed check results in a slip sometime during the rappel (the DM decides on the damage suffered). A character can rappel at a speed equal to his normal dungeon movement (120 feet per round for an unencumbered human). One other thing to bear in mind is that there must be a landing point at the end of the rope. Rappelling 60 feet down a 100-foot cliff means the character is either stranded at the end of the rope or, worse still, rappels right off the end and covers the last 40 feet much faster than he did the first 60!
