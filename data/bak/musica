Rock & Roll~
It's been a long time since I Rock & Rolled,
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back,
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from.
It's been a long time, been a long time,
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.
Yes it has.
It's been a long time since the book of love,
I can't count the tears of a life with no love.
Carry me back, carry me back,
Carry me back, baby, where I come from.
It's been a long time, been a long time,
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight,
Making vows that just can't work right.
OPEN YOUR ARMS, OPEN YOUR ARMS,
OPEN YOUR ARMS, baby, let my love come running in.
It's been a long time, been a long time,
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

The Rain Song~
This is the springtime of my loving
the second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
so little warmth I've felt before
it isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low.
It is the summer of my smiles
flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune.
Ain't so hard to recognize
These things are clear to all from
Time to Time. Ooooh..
Talk Talk
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us...
But I know that I love you so.
But I know that I love you so.
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder od devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mistery of the quotient
Upon us all a little rain
must fall
Just a little rain?
Ooooh, yeah yeah yeah!

All along the watchtower~
"There must be some way out of here,"
said the Joker to the thief,
"There's too much confusion,
I can't get no relief
Bussinessmen they drink my wine,
plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth"
"No reason to get exited,"
the thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many among us
whe feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that 
and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late"
All along the watchtower
Princess kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were aproaching
The wind began to bowl.

Jimi Hendrix~
Little Wing~
Well she's walking through the clouds
with a circus mind that's running wild
butterflies and zebras , and moonbeams
and fairy tales ,riding with the wind ...
When I'm sad she comes to me
with a thousand smiles she gives to me free
and it's allright , she said it's alright
take anything you want for me ...anything

The Man Who Sold the World~
We passed upon the stair,we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there,he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone,a long long time ago
Oh no,not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World
I laughed and shook his hand,and made my way back home
I searched for form and land,for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here
We must have died along,a long long time ago
Who knows? not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World

Kissed by a rose~
There used to be a graying time all alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remain a drug gets me high, that's how I feel
Did you know that when it snows my eyes become enlarged 
And the light that you shine can be see
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
The more I get of you, stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grey
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy, babe?
But did you know that when it snows, my eyes become enlarged
And the light that you shine can be seen
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey       
The more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah 
Now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grey
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey, I've been kissed by a rose
I've been kissed by a rise on the grey   (If I should fall...)
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy, babe
But did you know, that when it snows, my eyes become enlarged
And the light that you shine can be seen
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
The more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grey

Comfortably Numb~
Hello hello helo...
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now.
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain,
Get you on your feet again.
Relax relax relax...
I need some information first.
Just the basic facts:
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I had a fever.
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I got that feeling once again.
I can't explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
Ok ok ok...
Just a little pinprick. <ping>
There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working. Good.
That'll keep you going for the show.
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

Imagine~
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

I Still Haven't Found What I'm...~
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm as the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
But yes I'm still running
You broke the bonds
You loosed the chains
You carried the cross
And my shame
And my shame
You know I believe it
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

Sweet Child O' Mine~
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that
special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me
of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Sweet child o' mine

Welcome to the Jungle~
Welcome to the jungle

Honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey
We got your disease

Knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl
That's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream
Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here everyday
Ya learn ta live like an animal
In the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed
And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down, YEAH!
You know where you are
You're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die

Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
knees, knees

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
knees, knees
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down-HA!

Where the Streets Have No Name~
I want to run
I want to hide
I want to tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I want to reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name
I want to feel sunlight on my face
See that dust cloud disappear without a trace
I want to take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building
Then burning down love, burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you ....
It's all I can do
The cities a flood
And our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Still building
Then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
~
U2~
With or Without You~
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Slight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait....without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing left to win
And nothing else to lose
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

Beastie Boys~
So what'cha want~
Just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you'd think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly you know I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm a tell you all why
So tell me who are you dissing maybe I'm missing
The reason that I'm smiling or wilding so listen
In my head I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down
Let it flow like a mud slide
When I get on I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text y'all
I get props at my mention 'cause I vex y'all
So what'cha want
You're so funny with the money that you flaunt
Where'd you get your information from
You think that you can front when revelation comes
You can't front on that
Well they call me Mike D. the ever loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee I'm the metropolitician
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar
But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping
Goin' from mic to mic kickin' it wall to wall
I'll be calling out you people like a casting call
It's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know with your flow when you're out getting by
Believe me what you see is what you get
And you see me coming off as you can bet
I think I'm losing my mind this time
This time I'm losing my mind
You can't front on that
But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving it's due time that I walk about
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize
Well I'm dr. Spock I'm here to rock y'all
I want you off the wall if you're playing this wall
So what'cha want
Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner
Victor the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena
I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason but no cause
So if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews you'll be sucking like a leach
You can't front on that
So what'cha want
~
Beastie Boys~
Pass the mic~
If you can feel what I'm feeling then it's a musical masterpiece
But if you can hear what I'm dealing with then that's cool at least
What's running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk
And this is me, y'all-I M.C.,
Y'all my name is M.C.A. and I still do what I please
And now I'd like to introduce
I'll pass the mic to D. for a fist full of truth
The name is D., y'all and I don't play
And I can rock a block party 'til your hair turns grey
"So what you sayin?" I explode on site
And like Jimmy Walker I'm "Dynomite"
And now I'd like to pass the mic
So Adrock c'mon and do anything you like
I'm the A.D.R.O.C.K.
In the place with the bass I'm going all the way
I can't stop y'all tock tick y'all
And if you think that you're slick you'll catch a brick y'all
'Cause I'm a turn it in and I'm a turn it out
But now I've got to pass the mic to Yauch
Well on and on and on and on
I can't stop y'all 'til the early morn'
So rock y'all tick tock y'all to the beat y'all
C'mon and rock y'all
I give thanks for inspiration
It guides my mind along the way
A lot of people get jealous, they're talking about me
But that's just 'cause they haven't got a thing to say
Everybody's rappin' like it's a commercial
Acting like life is a big commercial
So this is what I've got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
And now I'd like to pass the mic to the A
So what's your name, Yauch? My name is M.C.A.
I've been coming to where I am, from the get go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
And now I'd like to pass the mic to my brother Adrock
C'mon and shine like a light
Yes yes y'all and yes yes y'all
I'm always on time never the less y'all
And that's right y'all, I shed light y'all
I've got no time in my life to get uptight y'all
So what you gonna say that I don't know already?
I'm like Clyde and I'm rockin' steady
But time flies when you're having fun
So Mike D. c'mon and get some
M.I.K.E. to the D.
You come and see me and you pay a fee
Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Now Ad-Rock and M.C.A.
Let's rock this joint in the old school way
Well I'm on 'til the crack of dawn
Mowing down M.C.'s like I'm mowing a lawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
You think we'll ever meet Stevie? One of these days, D.
But I can stand my ground and I am down
To wax an M.C. who acts like a clown
But for now, I'd like to ask you how
You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowd

Sabotage~
i can't stand it i know you planned it
but i'm gonna set it straight, this watergate
i can't stand rockin' when i'm in here
because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
so while you sit back and wonder why
i got this fuckin' thorn in my side
oh my, it's a mirage
i'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage
so listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
you'll shut me down with a push of your button?
but i'm out, and i'm gone
i'll tell you now i keep it on and on
'cause what you see you might not get
and we can't bet so don't you get souped yet
you're schmeing on a thing that's a mirage
i'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
why; our backs are now against the wall
listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
i can't stand it, i know you planned it
but i'm gonna set it straight this watergate
i can't stand rockin' when i'm in this place
because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
but make no mistakes and switch up my channel
i'm buddy rich when i fly off the handle
what could it be, it's a miracle
you're scheming on a thing; that's sabotage

Number of the beast~
Woe to you, Oh Earth and Sea,for the Devil send the beast
with wrath, because he knows the time is short...
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
for it is a human number,its number is Six hundred and sixty six.
I left alone my mind was blanck
I needed time to get  the memories from my mind
What did I see, can I believe
that what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy
Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
Cos in my dreams,it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
and brings me to despair.
The night was blanck was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
was all this real or some kind of hell
666 The Number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
as they start to cru hands held to the sky
in the night the fires burning bright
the ritual has begun Satan's work is done
666 The Number of the Beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight.
This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
buy I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
they seem to mesmerise me...can't avoid their eyes
666 the one for you and me
I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course.

The Great Southern Trendkill~
It's wearing on my mind, I'm speaking all my doubts aloud
You rob a dead mans grave, then flaunt it like you did create
If I hit bottom and everythings gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run
It's digging time again, you're nurturing the weakest trend
Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking
Fuck your magazine, and fuck the long dead plastic scene
Pierce a new hole, if Hell was "in"
you'd give your soul
THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
That's right,
THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
Buy it at a store, from MTV to on the floor
You look just like a star, it's proof you don't know who you are
It's bullshit time again, you'll save the world within your trend
Politically relieved, you're product sold and well received
The right words spoken gold, if I was God you'd sell your soul to...
THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
That's right,
