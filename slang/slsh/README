slsh (slang-shell) is a work in progress.  See the scripts/
subdirectory for examples.

Usage: slsh [--help ] [ --version ] [FILENAME ...]

Upon startup, the program will search for a file called slsh.rc and
try to interpret it's contents before reading in the script file. If
the environment variable SLSH_LIB_DIR exists, it will look in that
directory for slsh.rc.  Otherwise, if SLSH_LIB_DIR is not defined, it
will search the following directories:

    /usr/local/lib/slsh/
    /usr/local/slsh/
    /usr/lib/slsh/
    /etc/slsh/

A sample slrn.rc file is in the lib subdirectory.
